Here we present data from the first phase of the Chinese Pangenome Consortium, including a collection of 116 high-quality and haplotype-phased de novo assemblies based on 58 core samples representing 36 minority Chinese ethnic groups. With an average 30.65× high-fidelity long-read sequence coverage, an average contiguity N50 of more than 35.63 megabases and an average total size of 3.01 gigabases, the CPC core assemblies add 189 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,367 protein-coding gene duplications to GRCh38. We identified 15.9 million small variants and 78,072 structural variants, of which 5.9 million small variants and 34,223 structural variants were not reported in a recently released pangenome reference1. The Chinese Pangenome Consortium data demonstrate a remarkable increase in the discovery of novel and missing sequences when individuals are included from underrepresented minority ethnic groups. The missing reference sequences were enriched with archaic-derived alleles and genes that confer essential functions related to keratinization, response to ultraviolet radiation, DNA repair, immunological responses and lifespan, implying great potential for shedding new light on human evolution and recovering missing heritability in complex disease mapping."

Alternate alleles determined by variant callers can be used to construct pangenome graphs, but advances in long-read sequencing are leading to widely available, high-quality phased assemblies. Constructing a pangenome graph directly from assemblies, as opposed to variant calls, leverages the graph's ability to represent variation at different scales. Here we present the Minigraph-Cactus pangenome pipeline, which creates pangenomes directly from whole-genome alignments, and demonstrate its ability to scale to 90 human haplotypes from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium. The method builds graphs containing all forms of genetic variation while allowing use of current mapping and genotyping tools. We measure the effect of the quality and completeness of reference genomes used for analysis within the pangenomes and show that using the CHM13 reference from the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium improves the accuracy of our methods. We also demonstrate construction of a Drosophila melanogaster pangenome."

Yet for many years, the human genome reference sequence remained incomplete and lacked representation of human genetic diversity. Recently, two major advances have emerged to address these shortcomings: complete gap-free human genome sequences, such as the one developed by the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium, and high-quality pangenomes, such as the one developed by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium. Facilitated by advances in long-read DNA sequencing and genome assembly algorithms, complete human genome sequences resolve regions that have been historically difficult to sequence, including centromeres, telomeres, and segmental duplications. In parallel, pangenomes capture the extensive genetic diversity across populations worldwide. Together, these advances usher in a new era of genomics research, enhancing the accuracy of genomic analysis, paving the path for precision medicine, and contributing to deeper insights into human biology."

Investigating these patterns can help us to understand the role of selection in the evolution of bacterial pangenomes and how bacteria adapt to a new niche. Predicting the presence or absence of genes can be a highly error-prone process that can confound efforts to understand the dynamics of horizontal gene transfer. This review discusses both the challenges in accurately constructing a pangenome and the potential consequences errors can have on downstream analyses. We hope that by summarizing these issues researchers will be able to avoid potential pitfalls, leading to improved bacterial pangenome analyses."

Poplars, among the world's most widely distributed and cultivated trees, exhibit extensive phenotypic diversity and environmental adaptability. In this study, we present a genus-level super-pangenome comprising 19 Populus genomes, revealing the likely pivotal role of private genes in facilitating local environmental and climate adaptation. Through the integration of pangenomes with transcriptomes, methylomes, and chromatin accessibility mapping, we unveil that the evolutionary trajectories of pangenes and duplicated genes are closely linked to local genomic landscapes of regulatory and epigenetic architectures, notably CG methylation in gene-body regions. Further comparative genomic analyses have enabled the identification of 142 202 structural variants across species that intersect with a significant number of genes and contribute substantially to both phenotypic and adaptive divergence. We have experimentally validated a ∼180-bp presence/absence variant affecting the expression of the CUC2 gene, crucial for leaf serration formation. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web-based tool encompassing the multi-omics resources associated with the Populus super-pangenome (http://www.populus-superpangenome.com).

Here we report a pangenome of barley comprising long-read sequence assemblies of 76 wild and domesticated genomes and short-read sequence data of 1,315 genotypes. An expanded catalogue of sequence variation in the crop includes structurally complex loci that are rich in gene copy number variation. To demonstrate the utility of the pangenome, we focus on four loci involved in disease resistance, plant architecture, nutrient release and trichome development. Novel allelic variation at a powdery mildew resistance locus and population-specific copy number gains in a regulator of vegetative branching were found. Expansion of a family of starch-cleaving enzymes in elite malting barleys was linked to shifts in enzymatic activity in micro-malting trials. Deletion of an enhancer motif is likely to change the developmental trajectory of the hairy appendages on barley grains. Our findings indicate that allelic diversity at structurally complex loci may have helped crop plants to adapt to new selective regimes in agricultural ecosystems."

Here, we present PanKmer, a toolkit designed for reference-free analysis of pangenome datasets consisting of dozens to thousands of individual genomes. PanKmer decomposes a set of input genomes into a table of observed k-mers and their presence-absence values in each genome. These are stored in an efficient k-mer index data format that encodes SNPs, INDELs, and SVs. It also includes functions for downstream analysis of the k-mer index, such as calculating sequence similarity statistics between individuals at whole-genome or local scales. For example, k-mers can be ""anchored"" in any individual genome to quantify sequence variability or conservation at a specific locus. This facilitates workflows with various biological applications, e.g. identifying cases of hybridization between plant species. PanKmer provides researchers with a valuable and convenient means to explore the full scope of genetic variation in a population, without reference bias. PanKmer is implemented as a Python package with components written in Rust, released under a BSD license.

These graph-based, gapless pangenome references, which are enriched in terms of genomic diversity, completeness, and contiguity, have the potential for enhancing long-read sequencing (LRS)-based genomic research, as well as improving mappability and variant genotyping on traditional short-read sequencing platforms. We comprehensively discuss the advancements in pangenome-based genomic integrative genomic discoveries across forensic-related species (humans, animals, and plants) and summarize their applications in variant identification and forensic genomics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, and microbiome research. Recent developments in multiplexed array sequencing have introduced a highly efficient and programmable technique to overcome the limitations of short forensic marker lengths in LRS platforms. This technique enables the concatenation of short RNA transcripts and DNA fragments into LRS-optimal molecules for sequencing, assembly, and genotyping. The integration of new pangenome reference coordinates and corresponding computational algorithms will benefit forensic integrative genomics by facilitating new marker identification, accurate genotyping, high-resolution panel development, and the updating of statistical algorithms. This review highlights the necessity of integrating LRS-based platforms, pangenome-based study designs, and graph-based pangenome references in short-read mapping and LRS-based innovations to achieve precision forensic science."

Our pangenome-wide presence and absence variation (PAV) analysis revealed 5,120 PAV-related genes, highlighting a wide range of variety-specific genes and genes with varying frequencies across yak populations. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on binary gene PAV data classified yaks into three new groups: wild, domestic, and Jinchuan. Moreover, we proposed a 'two-haplotype genomic hybridization model' for understanding the hybridization patterns among breeds by integrating gene frequency, heterozygosity, and gene PAV data. A gene PAV-GWAS identified a novel gene (BosGru3G009179) that may be associated with the multirib trait in Jinchuan yaks. Furthermore, an integrated transcriptome and pangenome analysis highlighted the significant differences in the expression of core genes and the mutational burden of differentially expressed genes between yaks from high and low altitudes. Transcriptome analysis across multiple species revealed that yaks have the most unique differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs (between high- and low-altitude regions), especially in the heart and lungs, when comparing high- and low-altitude adaptations.

Pangenomic studies have detected structural variants in plant genomes, dissected the genetic architecture of agronomic traits, and helped unravel molecular underpinnings and evolutionary origins of plant phenotypes. The pangenome concept has further evolved into a so-called superpangenome that includes wild relatives within a genus or clade and shifted to graph-based reference systems.

In this study, we define notions of matching statistics of two ED strings as similarity measures between pangenomes and, consequently infer a corresponding distance measure.

We also implemented our methods as a software tool for pangenome comparison and evaluated their efficiency and effectiveness using both synthetic and real datasets. As for efficiency, we compare the runtime of the intersection graph method against the classic product automaton construction showing that the intersection graph is faster by up to one order of magnitude.

Some species have fluid pangenomes, with a high proportion of genes varying between individual genomes. Other species have less fluid pangenomes, with different genomes tending to contain the same genes. Two main hypotheses have been suggested to explain this variation: differences in species' bacterial lifestyle and effective population size. However, previous studies have not been able to test between these hypotheses because the different features of lifestyle and effective population size are highly correlated with each other, and phylogenetically conserved, making it hard to disentangle their relative importance. We used phylogeny-based analyses, across 126 bacterial species, to tease apart the causal role of different factors. We found that pangenome fluidity was lower in i) host-associated compared with free-living species and ii) host-associated species that are obligately dependent on a host, live inside cells, and are more pathogenic and less motile. In contrast, we found no support for the competing hypothesis that larger effective population sizes lead to more fluid pangenomes. Effective population size appears to correlate with pangenome variation because it is also driven by bacterial lifestyle, rather than because of a causal relationship."

Our objective was to evaluate the site-specialization of Gemella species among various habitats within the mouth by combining pangenomics and metagenomics. With pangenomics, we identified genome relationships and categorized genes as core and accessory to each species. With metagenomics, we identified the primary oral habitat of individual genomes. Our results establish that the genomes of three species, G. haemolysans, G. sanguinis and G. morbillorum, are abundant and prevalent in human mouths at different oral sites: G. haemolysans on buccal mucosa and keratinized gingiva; G. sanguinis on tongue dorsum, throat, and tonsils; and G. morbillorum in dental plaque. The gene-level basis of site-specificity was investigated by identifying genes that were core to Gemella genomes at a specific oral site but absent from other Gemella genomes.

However, the genomic interpretation of these viruses is hampered by a lack of functional information, stemming from the surprising number of hypothetical genes of unknown function. It is also unclear how many of these genes are widely shared within the clade. Using one of the most extensively characterized genera, Coccolithovirus, as a case study, we combined pangenome analysis, multiple functional annotation tools, AlphaFold structural modeling, and literature analysis to compare the core and accessory pangenome and assess support for novel functional predictions. We determined that the Coccolithovirus pangenome shares 30% of its genes with all 14 strains, making up the core. Notably, 34% of its genes were found in at most three strains. Core genes were enriched in early expression based on a transcriptomic dataset of Coccolithovirus EhV-201 algal infection, were more likely to be similar to host proteins than the non-core set, and were more likely to be involved in vital functions such as replication, recombination, and repair. In addition, we generated and collated annotations for the EhV representative EhV-86 from 12 different annotation sources, building up information for 142 previously hypothetical and putative membrane proteins. AlphaFold was further able to predict structures for 204 EhV-86 proteins with a modelling accuracy of good-high. These functional clues, combined with generated AlphaFold structures, provide a foundational framework for the future characterization of this model genus (and other giant viruses) and a further look into the evolution of the Coccolithovirus proteome."

Outside the setting of gastroenteritis, little work has been done to describe the genomic content and relatedness of the species, especially regarding clinical isolates. We reviewed the epidemiology of clinical C. ureolyticus cultured by our institution over the past 10 years. Fifty-one unique C. ureolyticus isolates were identified between January 2010 and August 2022, mostly originating from abscesses and blood cultures. To clarify the taxonomic relationships between isolates and to attribute specific genes with different clinical manifestations, we sequenced 19 available isolates from a variety of clinical specimen types and conducted a pangenomic analysis with publicly available C. ureolyticus genomes. Digital DNA:DNA hybridization suggested that these C. ureolyticus comprised a species complex of 10 species clusters (SCs) and several subspecies clusters. Although some orthologous genes or gene functions were enriched in isolates found in different SCs and clinical specimens, no association was significant. Nearly a third of the isolates possessed antimicrobial resistance genes, including the ermA resistance gene, potentially conferring resistance to macrolides, the treatment of choice for severe human campylobacteriosis. This work effectively doubles the number of publicly available C. ureolyticus genomes, provides further clarification of taxonomic relationships within this bacterial complex, and identifies target SCs for future analysis."

Here, we argue that this diversity of gene pools carried by different strains is maintained largely due to the control exercised by viral predation. Viruses maintain a high strain diversity through time that we describe as constant-diversity equilibrium, preventing the hoarding of resources by specific clones. Thus, viruses facilitate the release and degradation of dissolved organic matter in the ocean, which may lead to better ecosystem functioning by linking top-down to bottom-up control. By maintaining this equilibrium, viruses act as a key element of the adaptation of marine microbes to their environment and likely behave as a single evolutionary unit."

Ferragina and Fischer [1] observed in 2007 that word-based indexes often use fewer random accesses than character-based indexes, and thus support faster searches. Since DNA lacks natural word-boundaries, however, it is necessary to parse it somehow before applying word-based FM-indexing. In 2022, Deng et al. [2] proposed parsing genomic data by induced suffix sorting, and showed that the resulting word-based FM-indexes support faster counting queries than standard FM-indexes when patterns are a few thousand characters or longer. In this paper we show that using prefix-free parsing-which takes parameters that let us tune the average length of the phrases-instead of induced suffix sorting, gives a significant speedup for patterns of only a few hundred characters. We implement our method and demonstrate it is between 3 and 18 times faster than competing methods on queries to GRCh38, and is consistently faster on queries made to 25,000, 50,000 and 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

By comparison and integration of multiple genomes under the guidance of pan-genome theory, we can estimate the genomic information range of a species, leading to a global understanding of its genetic diversity. Combining pan-genome with large size chromosomal structural variations, high throughput population resequencing, and multi-omics data, we can profoundly study the genetic basis behind species traits we focus on. Soybean is one of the most important commercial crops over the world. It is also essential to our food security. Dissecting the formation of genetic diversity and the causal loci of key agricultural traits of soybean will make the modern soybean breeding more efficiently.

Then we used the soybean pan-genome work as a case study to introduce the general way to study pan-genome. We highlighted the contribution of structural variation (SV) to the evolution/domestication of soybean and its value in understanding the genetic bases of agronomy traits.

While domestic animals tend to have complex routes of origin and migration, suggesting a possible omission of some population-specific sequences in the current reference genome. Conversely, the pangenome is a collection of all DNA sequences of a species that contains sequences shared by all individuals (core genome) and is also able to display sequence information unique to each individual (variable genome). The progress of pangenome research in humans, plants and domestic animals has proved that the missing genetic components and the identification of large structural variants (SVs) can be explored through pangenomic studies. Many individual specific sequences have been shown to be related to biological adaptability, phenotype and important economic traits. The maturity of technologies and methods such as third-generation sequencing, Telomere-to-telomere genomes, graphic genomes, and reference-free assembly will further promote the development of pangenome. In the future, pangenome combined with long-read data and multi-omics will help to resolve large SVs and their relationship with the main economic traits of interest in domesticated animals, providing better insights into animal domestication, evolution and breeding. In this review, we mainly discuss how pangenome analysis reveals genetic variations in domestic animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, chickens) and their impacts on phenotypes and how this can contribute to the understanding of species diversity.

VRPG provides efficient and intuitive support for exploring and annotating pangenome graphs along a linear-genome-based coordinate system (e.g., that of a primary linear reference genome). Moreover, VRPG offers many unique features such as in-graph path highlighting for graph-constituent input assemblies, copy number characterization for graph-embedding nodes, and graph-based mapping for query sequences, all of which are highly valuable for researchers working with pangenome graphs. Additionally, VRPG enables side-by-side visualization between the graph-based pangenome representation and the conventional primary linear reference genome-based feature annotations, therefore seamlessly bridging the graph and linear genomic contexts.

Here, we present Wheelie, an algorithm that combines a renaming heuristic with a permutation solver (Wheelie-PR) or a Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solver (Wheelie-SMT) to check whether a given graph has the Wheeler properties, a problem that is NP-complete in general. Wheelie can check a variety of random and real-world graphs in far less time than any algorithm proposed to date. It can check a graph with 1,000s of nodes in seconds. We implement these algorithms together with complementary visualization tools in the WGT toolkit, available as open source software at https://github.com/Kuanhao-Chao/Wheeler_Graph_Toolkit."

In a recent article, Beavan et al. investigate this balance by applying machine learning models to microbial pangenomes. The presence of almost one-third of genes can be reliably inferred, indicating a surprising amount of predictable evolution."

Bacteroides fragilis is a Gram-negative anaerobe that is a member of the human gastrointestinal microbiota and is frequently found as an extra-intestinal opportunistic pathogen. B. fragilis comprises two distinct groups - divisions I and II - characterized by the presence/absence of genes [cepA and ccrA (cfiA), respectively] that confer resistance to β-lactam antibiotics by either serine or metallo-β-lactamase production. No large-scale analyses of publicly available B. fragilis sequence data have been undertaken, and the resistome of the species remains poorly defined.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Reclassification of divisions I and II B. fragilis as two distinct species has been proposed but additional evidence is required.Aims. To investigate the genomic diversity of GenBank B. fragilis genomes and establish the prevalence of division I and II strains among publicly available B. fragilis genomes, and to generate further evidence to demonstrate that B. fragilis division I and II strains represent distinct genomospecies.Methodology. High-quality (n=377) genomes listed as B. fragilis in GenBank were included in pangenome and functional analyses. Genome data were also subject to resistome profiling using The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database.Results. Average nucleotide identity and phylogenetic analyses showed B. fragilis divisions I and II represent distinct species: B. fragilis sensu stricto (n=275 genomes) and B. fragilis A (n=102 genomes; Genome Taxonomy Database designation), respectively. Exploration of the pangenome of B. fragilis sensu stricto and B. fragilis A revealed separation of the two species at the core and accessory gene levels.Conclusion. The findings indicate that B. fragilis A, previously referred to as division II B. fragilis, is an individual species and distinct from B. fragilis sensu stricto. The B. fragilis pangenome analysis supported previous genomic, phylogenetic and resistome screening analyses collectively reinforcing that divisions I and II are two separate species. In addition, it was confirmed that differences in the accessory genes of B. fragilis divisions I and II are primarily associated with carbohydrate metabolism and suggest that differences other than antimicrobial resistance could also be used to distinguish between these two species."
