Here we present data from the first phase of the Chinese Pangenome Consortium, including a collection of 116 high-quality and haplotype-phased de novo assemblies based on 58 core samples representing 36 minority Chinese ethnic groups. With an average 30.65× high-fidelity long-read sequence coverage, an average contiguity N50 of more than 35.63 megabases and an average total size of 3.01 gigabases, the CPC core assemblies add 189 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,367 protein-coding gene duplications to GRCh38. We identified 15.9 million small variants and 78,072 structural variants, of which 5.9 million small variants and 34,223 structural variants were not reported in a recently released pangenome reference1. The Chinese Pangenome Consortium data demonstrate a remarkable increase in the discovery of novel and missing sequences when individuals are included from underrepresented minority ethnic groups. The missing reference sequences were enriched with archaic-derived alleles and genes that confer essential functions related to keratinization, response to ultraviolet radiation, DNA repair, immunological responses and lifespan, implying great potential for shedding new light on human evolution and recovering missing heritability in complex disease mapping.",pangenome

Constructing a pangenome graph directly from assemblies, as opposed to variant calls, leverages the graph's ability to represent variation at different scales. Here we present the Minigraph-Cactus pangenome pipeline, which creates pangenomes directly from whole-genome alignments, and demonstrate its ability to scale to 90 human haplotypes from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium. The method builds graphs containing all forms of genetic variation while allowing use of current mapping and genotyping tools. We measure the effect of the quality and completeness of reference genomes used for analysis within the pangenomes and show that using the CHM13 reference from the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium improves the accuracy of our methods.

Yet for many years, the human genome reference sequence remained incomplete and lacked representation of human genetic diversity. Recently, two major advances have emerged to address these shortcomings: complete gap-free human genome sequences, such as the one developed by the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium, and high-quality pangenomes, such as the one developed by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium. Facilitated by advances in long-read DNA sequencing and genome assembly algorithms, complete human genome sequences resolve regions that have been historically difficult to sequence, including centromeres, telomeres, and segmental duplications. In parallel, pangenomes capture the extensive genetic diversity across populations worldwide.

Poplars, among the world's most widely distributed and cultivated trees, exhibit extensive phenotypic diversity and environmental adaptability. In this study, we present a genus-level super-pangenome comprising 19 Populus genomes, revealing the likely pivotal role of private genes in facilitating local environmental and climate adaptation. Through the integration of pangenomes with transcriptomes, methylomes, and chromatin accessibility mapping, we unveil that the evolutionary trajectories of pangenes and duplicated genes are closely linked to local genomic landscapes of regulatory and epigenetic architectures, notably CG methylation in gene-body regions. Further comparative genomic analyses have enabled the identification of 142 202 structural variants across species that intersect with a significant number of genes and contribute substantially to both phenotypic and adaptive divergence. We have experimentally validated a ∼180-bp presence/absence variant affecting the expression of the CUC2 gene, crucial for leaf serration formation.

An expanded catalogue of sequence variation in the crop includes structurally complex loci that are rich in gene copy number variation. To demonstrate the utility of the pangenome, we focus on four loci involved in disease resistance, plant architecture, nutrient release and trichome development. Novel allelic variation at a powdery mildew resistance locus and population-specific copy number gains in a regulator of vegetative branching were found. Expansion of a family of starch-cleaving enzymes in elite malting barleys was linked to shifts in enzymatic activity in micro-malting trials. Deletion of an enhancer motif is likely to change the developmental trajectory of the hairy appendages on barley grains.

Pangenome analysis predominantly leverages graph-based methods that require computationally intensive multiple genome alignments, do not scale to highly complex eukaryotic genomes, limit their scope to identifying structural variants (SVs), or incur bias by relying on a reference genome. Here, we present PanKmer, a toolkit designed for reference-free analysis of pangenome datasets consisting of dozens to thousands of individual genomes. PanKmer decomposes a set of input genomes into a table of observed k-mers and their presence-absence values in each genome. These are stored in an efficient k-mer index data format that encodes SNPs, INDELs, and SVs. It also includes functions for downstream analysis of the k-mer index, such as calculating sequence similarity statistics between individuals at whole-genome or local scales. For example, k-mers can be ""anchored"" in any individual genome to quantify sequence variability or conservation at a specific locus. This facilitates workflows with various biological applications, e.g. identifying cases of hybridization between plant species. PanKmer provides researchers with a valuable and convenient means to explore the full scope of genetic variation in a population, without reference bias. PanKmer is implemented as a Python package with components written in Rust, released under a BSD license.

These graph-based, gapless pangenome references, which are enriched in terms of genomic diversity, completeness, and contiguity, have the potential for enhancing long-read sequencing (LRS)-based genomic research, as well as improving mappability and variant genotyping on traditional short-read sequencing platforms. We comprehensively discuss the advancements in pangenome-based genomic integrative genomic discoveries across forensic-related species (humans, animals, and plants) and summarize their applications in variant identification and forensic genomics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, and microbiome research. Recent developments in multiplexed array sequencing have introduced a highly efficient and programmable technique to overcome the limitations of short forensic marker lengths in LRS platforms. This technique enables the concatenation of short RNA transcripts and DNA fragments into LRS-optimal molecules for sequencing, assembly, and genotyping. The integration of new pangenome reference coordinates and corresponding computational algorithms will benefit forensic integrative genomics by facilitating new marker identification, accurate genotyping, high-resolution panel development, and the updating of statistical algorithms. This review highlights the necessity of integrating LRS-based platforms, pangenome-based study designs, and graph-based pangenome references in short-read mapping and LRS-based innovations to achieve precision forensic science.",pangenome

Our pangenome-wide presence and absence variation (PAV) analysis revealed 5,120 PAV-related genes, highlighting a wide range of variety-specific genes and genes with varying frequencies across yak populations. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on binary gene PAV data classified yaks into three new groups: wild, domestic, and Jinchuan. Moreover, we proposed a 'two-haplotype genomic hybridization model' for understanding the hybridization patterns among breeds by integrating gene frequency, heterozygosity, and gene PAV data. A gene PAV-GWAS identified a novel gene (BosGru3G009179) that may be associated with the multirib trait in Jinchuan yaks. Furthermore, an integrated transcriptome and pangenome analysis highlighted the significant differences in the expression of core genes and the mutational burden of differentially expressed genes between yaks from high and low altitudes. Transcriptome analysis across multiple species revealed that yaks have the most unique differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs (between high- and low-altitude regions), especially in the heart and lungs, when comparing high- and low-altitude adaptations.

Some species have fluid pangenomes, with a high proportion of genes varying between individual genomes. Other species have less fluid pangenomes, with different genomes tending to contain the same genes. Two main hypotheses have been suggested to explain this variation: differences in species' bacterial lifestyle and effective population size. However, previous studies have not been able to test between these hypotheses because the different features of lifestyle and effective population size are highly correlated with each other, and phylogenetically conserved, making it hard to disentangle their relative importance. We used phylogeny-based analyses, across 126 bacterial species, to tease apart the causal role of different factors. We found that pangenome fluidity was lower in i) host-associated compared with free-living species and ii) host-associated species that are obligately dependent on a host, live inside cells, and are more pathogenic and less motile. In contrast, we found no support for the competing hypothesis that larger effective population sizes lead to more fluid pangenomes.

Our objective was to evaluate the site-specialization of Gemella species among various habitats within the mouth by combining pangenomics and metagenomics. With pangenomics, we identified genome relationships and categorized genes as core and accessory to each species. With metagenomics, we identified the primary oral habitat of individual genomes. Our results establish that the genomes of three species, G. haemolysans, G. sanguinis and G. morbillorum, are abundant and prevalent in human mouths at different oral sites: G. haemolysans on buccal mucosa and keratinized gingiva; G. sanguinis on tongue dorsum, throat, and tonsils; and G. morbillorum in dental plaque. The gene-level basis of site-specificity was investigated by identifying genes that were core to Gemella genomes at a specific oral site but absent from other Gemella genomes.

While the vg toolkit [Garrison et al. (Variation graph toolkit improves read mapping by representing genetic variation in the reference.

Genome Biol 2020;21:253-28)] is the state-of-the-art aligner of erroneous long reads. GraphAligner works by finding candidate read occurrences based on individually extending the best seeds of the read in the variation graph. However, a more principled approach recognized in the community is to co-linearly chain multiple seeds. We present a new algorithm to co-linearly chain a set of seeds in a string labeled acyclic graph, together with the first efficient implementation of such a co-linear chaining algorithm into a new aligner of erroneous long reads to acyclic variation graphs, GraphChainer. We run experiments aligning real and simulated PacBio CLR reads with average error rates 15% and 5%. Compared to GraphAligner, GraphChainer aligns 12-17% more reads, and 21-28% more total read length, on real PacBio CLR reads from human chromosomes 1, 22, and the whole human pangenome. On both simulated and real data, GraphChainer aligns between 95% and 99% of all reads, and of total read length. We also show that minigraph [Li et al.

However, the genomic interpretation of these viruses is hampered by a lack of functional information, stemming from the surprising number of hypothetical genes of unknown function. It is also unclear how many of these genes are widely shared within the clade. Using one of the most extensively characterized genera, Coccolithovirus, as a case study, we combined pangenome analysis, multiple functional annotation tools, AlphaFold structural modeling, and literature analysis to compare the core and accessory pangenome and assess support for novel functional predictions. We determined that the Coccolithovirus pangenome shares 30% of its genes with all 14 strains, making up the core. Notably, 34% of its genes were found in at most three strains. Core genes were enriched in early expression based on a transcriptomic dataset of Coccolithovirus EhV-201 algal infection, were more likely to be similar to host proteins than the non-core set, and were more likely to be involved in vital functions such as replication, recombination, and repair. In addition, we generated and collated annotations for the EhV representative EhV-86 from 12 different annotation sources, building up information for 142 previously hypothetical and putative membrane proteins. AlphaFold was further able to predict structures for 204 EhV-86 proteins with a modelling accuracy of good-high. These functional clues, combined with generated AlphaFold structures, provide a foundational framework for the future characterization of this model genus (and other giant viruses) and a further look into the evolution of the Coccolithovirus proteome.",pangenome

Fifty-one unique C. ureolyticus isolates were identified between January 2010 and August 2022, mostly originating from abscesses and blood cultures. To clarify the taxonomic relationships between isolates and to attribute specific genes with different clinical manifestations, we sequenced 19 available isolates from a variety of clinical specimen types and conducted a pangenomic analysis with publicly available C. ureolyticus genomes. Digital DNA:DNA hybridization suggested that these C. ureolyticus comprised a species complex of 10 species clusters (SCs) and several subspecies clusters.

Here, we argue that this diversity of gene pools carried by different strains is maintained largely due to the control exercised by viral predation. Viruses maintain a high strain diversity through time that we describe as constant-diversity equilibrium, preventing the hoarding of resources by specific clones. Thus, viruses facilitate the release and degradation of dissolved organic matter in the ocean, which may lead to better ecosystem functioning by linking top-down to bottom-up control. By maintaining this equilibrium, viruses act as a key element of the adaptation of marine microbes to their environment and likely behave as a single evolutionary unit.",pangenome

Ferragina and Fischer [1] observed in 2007 that word-based indexes often use fewer random accesses than character-based indexes, and thus support faster searches. Since DNA lacks natural word-boundaries, however, it is necessary to parse it somehow before applying word-based FM-indexing. In 2022, Deng et al. [2] proposed parsing genomic data by induced suffix sorting, and showed that the resulting word-based FM-indexes support faster counting queries than standard FM-indexes when patterns are a few thousand characters or longer. In this paper we show that using prefix-free parsing-which takes parameters that let us tune the average length of the phrases-instead of induced suffix sorting, gives a significant speedup for patterns of only a few hundred characters.

While domestic animals tend to have complex routes of origin and migration, suggesting a possible omission of some population-specific sequences in the current reference genome. Conversely, the pangenome is a collection of all DNA sequences of a species that contains sequences shared by all individuals (core genome) and is also able to display sequence information unique to each individual (variable genome). The progress of pangenome research in humans, plants and domestic animals has proved that the missing genetic components and the identification of large structural variants (SVs) can be explored through pangenomic studies. Many individual specific sequences have been shown to be related to biological adaptability, phenotype and important economic traits. The maturity of technologies and methods such as third-generation sequencing, Telomere-to-telomere genomes, graphic genomes, and reference-free assembly will further promote the development of pangenome. In the future, pangenome combined with long-read data and multi-omics will help to resolve large SVs and their relationship with the main economic traits of interest in domesticated animals, providing better insights into animal domestication, evolution and breeding. In this review, we mainly discuss how pangenome analysis reveals genetic variations in domestic animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, chickens) and their impacts on phenotypes and how this can contribute to the understanding of species diversity.

The pan-genomes of crops constructed from various cultivars, accessions, landraces, and wild ancestral species represent a compendium of genes and structural variations and allow researchers to search for the novel genes and alleles that were inadvertently lost in domesticated crops during the historical process of crop domestication or in the process of extensive plant breeding. Fortunately, many valuable genes and alleles associated with desirable traits like disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, plant architecture, and nutrition qualities exist in landraces, ancestral species, and crop wild relatives. The novel genes from the wild ancestors and landraces can be introduced back to high-yielding varieties of modern crops by implementing classical plant breeding, genomic selection, and transgenic/gene editing approaches. Thus, pan-genomic represents a great leap in plant research and offers new avenues for targeted breeding to mitigate the impact of global climate change.

To facilitate better exploration and understanding of pangenome graphs toward novel biological insights, here we present a web-based interactive visualization and interpretation framework for linear reference-projected pangenome graphs (VRPG). VRPG provides efficient and intuitive support for exploring and annotating pangenome graphs along a linear-genome-based coordinate system (e.g., that of a primary linear reference genome). Moreover, VRPG offers many unique features such as in-graph path highlighting for graph-constituent input assemblies, copy number characterization for graph-embedding nodes, and graph-based mapping for query sequences, all of which are highly valuable for researchers working with pangenome graphs. Additionally, VRPG enables side-by-side visualization between the graph-based pangenome representation and the conventional primary linear reference genome-based feature annotations, therefore seamlessly bridging the graph and linear genomic contexts. To further demonstrate its functionality and scalability, we applied VRPG to the cutting-edge yeast and human reference pangenome graphs derived from hundreds of high-quality genome assemblies via a dedicated web portal and examined their local genome diversity in the graph contexts.",pangenome

Here, we construct a graph pangenome from 24 haplotype assemblies representing seven taurine cattle breeds to identify and characterize the white-head-associated locus for the first time based on long-read sequencing data and pangenome analyses. We introduce a pangenome-wide association mapping approach that examines assembly path similarities within the graph to reveal an association between two most likely serial alleles of a complex structural variant (SV) 66 kb upstream of KIT and facial depigmentation. The complex SV contains a variable number of tandemly duplicated 14.3 kb repeats, consisting of LTRs, LINEs, and other repetitive elements, leading to misleading alignments of short and long reads when using a linear reference. We align 250 short-read sequencing samples spanning 15 cattle breeds to the pangenome graph, further validating that the alleles of the SV segregate with head depigmentation. We estimate an increased count of repeats in Hereford relative to Simmental and other white-headed cattle breeds from the graph alignment coverage, suggesting a large under-assembly in the current Hereford-based cattle reference genome, which had fewer copies.

Bacteroides fragilis is a Gram-negative anaerobe that is a member of the human gastrointestinal microbiota and is frequently found as an extra-intestinal opportunistic pathogen. B. fragilis comprises two distinct groups - divisions I and II - characterized by the presence/absence of genes [cepA and ccrA (cfiA), respectively] that confer resistance to β-lactam antibiotics by either serine or metallo-β-lactamase production. No large-scale analyses of publicly available B. fragilis sequence data have been undertaken, and the resistome of the species remains poorly defined.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Reclassification of divisions I and II B. fragilis as two distinct species has been proposed but additional evidence is required.Aims. To investigate the genomic diversity of GenBank B. fragilis genomes and establish the prevalence of division I and II strains among publicly available B. fragilis genomes, and to generate further evidence to demonstrate that B. fragilis division I and II strains represent distinct genomospecies.Methodology. High-quality (n=377) genomes listed as B. fragilis in GenBank were included in pangenome and functional analyses. Genome data were also subject to resistome profiling using The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database.Results. Average nucleotide identity and phylogenetic analyses showed B. fragilis divisions I and II represent distinct species: B. fragilis sensu stricto (n=275 genomes) and B. fragilis A (n=102 genomes; Genome Taxonomy Database designation), respectively. Exploration of the pangenome of B. fragilis sensu stricto and B. fragilis A revealed separation of the two species at the core and accessory gene levels.Conclusion. The findings indicate that B. fragilis A, previously referred to as division II B. fragilis, is an individual species and distinct from B. fragilis sensu stricto. The B. fragilis pangenome analysis supported previous genomic, phylogenetic and resistome screening analyses collectively reinforcing that divisions I and II are two separate species. In addition, it was confirmed that differences in the accessory genes of B. fragilis divisions I and II are primarily associated with carbohydrate metabolism and suggest that differences other than antimicrobial resistance could also be used to distinguish between these two species.",pangenome

Ferragina and Fischer [1] observed in 2007 that word-based indexes often use fewer random accesses than character-based indexes, and thus support faster searches. Since DNA lacks natural word-boundaries, however, it is necessary to parse it somehow before applying word-based FM-indexing. Last year, Deng et al. [2] proposed parsing genomic data by induced suffix sorting, and showed the resulting word-based FM-indexes support faster counting queries than standard FM-indexes when patterns are a few thousand characters or longer. In this paper we show that using prefix-free parsing-which takes parameters that let us tune the average length of the phrases-instead of induced suffix sorting, gives a significant speedup for patterns of only a few hundred characters. We implement our method and demonstrate it is between 3 and 18 times faster than competing methods on queries to GRCh38, and is consistently faster on queries made to 25,000, 50,000 and 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

The species selected to build the pangenome are a great representation of the genus, as illustrated by capturing known allelic variants in the sex-determining region and for Pierce's disease resistance loci.

Recent works show how the co-linear chaining problem can be efficiently solved for acyclic pangenome graphs by exploiting their small width and how incorporating gap cost in the scoring function improves alignment accuracy. However, it remains open on how to effectively generalize these techniques for general pangenome graphs which contain cycles.

Gene clustering is complicated by intraspecific duplications and horizontal gene transfers that are frequent in prokaryotes. In consequence, gene clustering methods must deal with a trade-off between identifying vertically transmitted representatives of multicopy gene families, which are recognizable by synteny conservation, and retrieving complete sets of species-level orthologs. We studied the implications of adopting homology, orthology, or synteny conservation as formal criteria for gene clustering by performing comparative analyses of 125 prokaryotic pangenomes. Clustering criteria affect pangenome functional characterization, core genome inference, and reconstruction of ancestral gene content to different extents. Species-wise estimates of pangenome and core genome sizes change by the same factor when using different clustering criteria, allowing robust cross-species comparisons regardless of the clustering criterion. However, cross-species comparisons of genome plasticity and functional profiles are substantially affected by inconsistencies among clustering criteria. Such inconsistencies are driven not only by mobile genetic elements, but also by genes involved in defense, secondary metabolism, and other accessory functions. In some pangenome features, the variability attributed to methodological inconsistencies can even exceed the effect sizes of ecological and phylogenetic variables. Choosing an appropriate criterion for gene clustering is critical to conduct unbiased pangenome analyses. We provide practical guidelines to choose the right method depending on the research goals and the quality of genome assemblies, and a benchmarking dataset to assess the robustness and reproducibility of future comparative studies.",pangenome

Due to advancements in sequencing and computational technology, it has become feasible to sequence the entire genome of numerous individuals of a single species at a reasonable cost. Pangenomes have been constructed for many major diploid crops, including rice, maize, soybean, sorghum, pearl millet, peas, sunflower, grapes, and mustards. However, pangenomes for polyploid species are relatively scarce and are available in only few crops including wheat, cotton, rapeseed, and potatoes. In this review, we explore the various methods used in crop pangenome development, discussing the challenges and implications of these techniques based on insights from published pangenome studies. We offer a systematic guide and discuss the tools available for constructing a pangenome and conducting downstream analyses. Alfalfa, a highly heterozygous, cross pollinated and autotetraploid forage crop species, is used as an example to discuss the concerns and challenges offered by polyploid crop species. We conducted a comparative analysis using linear and graph-based methods by constructing an alfalfa graph pangenome using three publicly available genome assemblies. To illustrate the intricacies captured by pangenome graphs for a complex crop genome, we used five different gene sequences and aligned them against the three graph-based pangenomes. The comparison of the three graph pangenome methods reveals notable variations in the genomic variation captured by each pipeline. Pangenome resources are proving invaluable by offering insights into core and dispensable genes, novel gene discovery, and genome-wide patterns of variation. Developing user-friendly online portals for linear pangenome visualization has made these resources accessible to the broader scientific and breeding community. However, challenges remain with graph-based pangenomes including compatibility with other tools, extraction of sequence for regions of interest, and visualization of genetic variation captured in pangenome graphs. These issues necessitate further refinement of tools and pipelines to effectively address the complexities of polyploid, highly heterozygous, and cross-pollinated species.",pangenome

TB infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis can occur in the lungs, causing pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), or in any other organ of the body, resulting in extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB). There is no consensus on the genetic determinants of this pathogen that may contribute to EPTB. In this study, we constructed the M. tuberculosis pangenome and used it as a tool to seek genomic signatures associated with the clinical presentation of TB based on its accessory genome differences. The analysis carried out in the present study includes the raw reads of 490 M. tuberculosis genomes (PTB n = 245, EPTB n = 245) retrieved from public databases that were assembled, as well as ten genomes from Mexican strains (PTB n = 5, EPTB n = 5) that were sequenced and assembled. All genomes were annotated and then used to construct the pangenome with Roary and Panaroo. The pangenome obtained using Roary consisted of 2231 core genes and 3729 accessory genes. On the other hand, the pangenome resulting from Panaroo consisted of 2130 core genes and 5598 accessory genes. Associations between the distribution of accessory genes and the PTB/EPTB phenotypes were examined using the Scoary and Pyseer tools. Both tools found a significant association between the hspR, plcD, Rv2550c, pe_pgrs5, pe_pgrs25, and pe_pgrs57 genes and the PTB genotype. In contrast, the deletion of the aceA, esxR, plcA, and ppe50 genes was significantly associated with the EPTB phenotype. Rv1759c and Rv3740 were found to be associated with the PTB phenotype according to Scoary; however, these associations were not observed when using Pyseer. The robustness of the constructed pangenome and the gene-phenotype associations is supported by several factors, including the analysis of a large number of genomes, the inclusion of the same number of PTB/EPTB genomes, and the reproducibility of results thanks to the different bioinformatic tools used. Such characteristics surpass most of previous M. tuberculosis pangenomes. Thus, it can be inferred that the deletion of these genes can lead to changes in the processes involved in stress response and fatty acid metabolism, conferring phenotypic advantages associated with pulmonary or extrapulmonary presentation of TB. This study represents the first attempt to use the pangenome to seek gene-phenotype associations in M. tuberculosis.",pangenome

Such heritable traits emerge in response to different environmental niches and can have a profound influence on microbial community dynamics. As a consequence, any individual genome or population will contain merely a fraction of the total genetic diversity of any operationally defined ""species"", whose ecological potential can thus be only fully understood by studying all of their genomes and the genes therein. This concept, known as the pangenome, is valuable for studying microbial ecology and evolution, as it partitions genomes into core (present in all the genomes from a species, and responsible for housekeeping and species-level niche adaptation among others) and accessory regions (present only in some, and responsible for intra-species differentiation). Here we present SuperPang, an algorithm producing pangenome assemblies from a set of input genomes of varying quality, including metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). SuperPang runs in linear time and its results are complete, non-redundant, preserve gene ordering and contain both coding and non-coding regions. Our approach provides a modular view of the pangenome, identifying operons and genomic islands, and allowing to track their prevalence in different populations. We illustrate this by analysing intra-species diversity in Polynucleobacter, a bacterial genus ubiquitous in freshwater ecosystems, characterized by their streamlined genomes and their ecological versatility. We show how SuperPang facilitates the simultaneous analysis of allelic and gene content variation under different environmental pressures, allowing us to study the drivers of microbial diversification at unprecedented resolution.",pangenome

However, bias can be reduced further by using a personalized reference, e.g. a diploid human reference constructed to match a donor individual's alleles. We present a novel impute-first alignment framework that combines elements of genotype imputation and pangenome alignment. It begins by genotyping the individual using only a subsample of the input reads. It next uses a reference panel and efficient imputation algorithm to impute a personalized diploid reference. Finally, it indexes the personalized reference and applies a read aligner, which could be a linear or graph aligner, to align the full read set to the personalized reference. This framework achieves higher variant-calling recall (99.54% vs. 99.37%), precision (99.36% vs. 99.18%), and F1 (99.45% vs. 99.28%) compared to a graph pangenome aligner.

Representing pangenomes requires innovative visualization formats that effectively convey the complex genomic structures and variations. This review delves into contemporary methodologies and recent advancements in constructing pangenomes, particularly in plant genomes. It examines the structure of pangenome representation, including format comparison, conversion, visualization techniques, and their implications for enhancing crop improvement strategies. Earlier comparative studies have illuminated novel gene sequences, copy number variations, and presence-absence variations across diverse crop species. The concept of a pan-genome, which captures multiple genetic variations from a broad spectrum of genotypes, offers a holistic perspective of a species' genetic makeup. However, constructing a pan-genome for plants with larger genomes poses challenges, including managing vast genome sequence data and comprehending the genetic variations within the germplasm. To address these challenges, researchers have explored cost-effective alternatives to encapsulate species diversity in a single assembly known as a pangenome. This involves reducing the volume of genome sequences while focusing on genetic variations. With the growing prominence of the pan-genome concept in plant genomics, several software tools have emerged to facilitate pangenome construction. This review sheds light on developing and utilizing software tools tailored for constructing pan-genomes in plants. It also discusses representation formats suitable for downstream analyses, offering valuable insights into the genetic landscape and evolutionary dynamics of plant species.

Here, we constructed a pangenome variation graph for 73 diverse Fusarium oxysporum genomes, a major fungal plant pathogen with a compartmentalized genome that includes conserved core as well as variable accessory chromosomes. To obtain insights into accessory chromosome dynamics, we first constructed a chromosome similarity network using all-vs-all similarity mapping. We identified eleven core chromosomes conserved across all strains and a substantial number of highly variable accessory chromosomes. Some of these accessory chromosomes are host-specific and likely play a role in determining host range. Using a k-mer based approach, we further identified the presence of these accessory chromosomes in all available (581) F. oxysporum assemblies and corroborated the occurrence of host-specific accessory chromosomes. To further analyze the evolution of chromosomes in F. oxysporum, we constructed a pangenome variation graph per group of homologous chromosomes. This reveals that accessory chromosomes are composed of different stretches of accessory regions, and possibly rearrangements between accessory regions gave rise to these mosaic accessory chromosomes. Furthermore, we show that accessory chromosomes are likely horizontally transferred in natural populations. Our findings demonstrate that a pangenome variation graph is a powerful approach to elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of accessory chromosomes in F. oxysporum, which is not only a useful resource for Fusarium but also provides a framework for similar analyses in other species containing accessory chromosomes.",pangenome

The Graph Alignment Format (GAF) is a text format, tab-delimited like BED/VCF files, which was proposed to represent alignments. GAF could also be used to store paths representing annotations in a pangenome graph, but there are no tools to index and query them efficiently. Here, we present extensions to vg and HTSlib that provide efficient sorting, indexing, and querying for GAF files. With this approach, annotations overlapping a subgraph can be extracted quickly. Paths are sorted based on the IDs of traversed nodes, compressed with BGZIP, and indexed with HTSlib/tabix via our extensions for the GAF format. Compared to the binary GAM format, GAF files are easier to edit or inspect because they are plain text, and we show that they are twice as fast to sort and half as large on disk. In addition, we updated vg annotate, which takes BED or GFF3 annotation files relative to linear sequences and projects them into the pangenome. It can now produce GAF files representing these annotations' paths through the pangenome. We showcase these new tools on several applications.

For species-level datasets, fast pangenome inference tools have been developed. However, tools applicable to more diverse datasets are currently slow and scale poorly. Here, we introduce SCARAP, a program containing three modules for comparative genomics analyses: a fast and scalable pangenome inference module, a direct core genome inference module, and a module for subsampling representative genomes. When benchmarked against existing tools, the SCARAP pan module proved up to an order of magnitude faster with comparable accuracy. The core module was validated by comparing its result against a core genome extracted from a full pangenome. The sample module demonstrated the rapid sampling of genomes with decreasing novelty. Applied to a dataset of over 31 000 Lactobacillales genomes, SCARAP showcased its ability to derive a representative pangenome.

Through bioinformatics analysis, we investigated the serotype, MLST, pan-genome characteristics, SNP, AMR, and ICE of the 19 S. suis isolates. Among the 19 S. suis strains, ten serotypes were identified, and serotype 9 was the most prevalent (21.05%). Ten new alleles and nine new sequence types (STs) were discovered, with ST28 and ST243 emerging as the predominant STs. The results of the pan-genomic analysis of S. suis indicate that there are 943 core genes, 2259 shell genes, and 5663 cloud genes. Through SNP evolutionary analysis, we identified a strong genetic similarity between SS31 and the reference genome P1/7. The analysis of antibiotic resistance genes revealed widespread presence of erm(B) and tet(O) genes among 19 strains of S. suis. This association may be linked to the high resistance of S. suis to lincosamides, macrolides, and tetracyclines. Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) and integrative and mobilizable elements (IMEs) were identified in 16 strains, with a carriage rate of 84.21%, and resistance genes were identified within the ICE/IME elements of 8 strains. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that all strains showed sensitivity to vancomycin and lincomycin but resistance to tilmicosin, tiamulin, amoxicillin, and doxycycline. This study contributes to our understanding of the genomic diversity of S. suis in Hubei Province of China, providing essential data for the comprehensive prevention and control of S. suis infections in China.",pangenome

It, however, was shown to infect a wide range of hosts apart from vertebrates such as insects or plants as well, being either pathogenic or growth-promoting for the latter. Despite being extensively studied in terms of virulence mechanisms during human infections, there has been little evidence of which factors determine S. marcescens host specificity. On that account, we analyzed S. marcescens pangenome to reveal possible specificity factors. We selected 73 high-quality genome assemblies of complete level and reconstructed the respective pangenome and reference phylogeny based on core genes alignment. To find an optimal pipeline, we tested current pangenomic tools and obtained several phylogenetic inferences. The pangenome was rich in its accessory component and was considered open according to the Heaps' law. We then applied the pangenome-wide associating method (pan-GWAS) and predicted positively associated gene clusters attributed to three host groups, namely, humans, insects, and plants. According to the results, significant factors relating to human infections included transcriptional regulators, lipoproteins, ABC transporters, and membrane proteins. Host preference toward insects, in its turn, was associated with diverse enzymes, such as hydrolases, isochorismatase, and N-acetyltransferase with the latter possibly exerting a neurotoxic effect. Finally, plant infection may be conducted through type VI secretion systems and modulation of plant cell wall synthesis. Interestingly, factors associated with plants also included putative growth-promoting proteins like enzymes performing xenobiotic degradation and releasing ammonium irons. We also identified overrepresented functional annotations within the sets of specificity factors and found that their functional characteristics fell into separate clusters, thus, implying that host adaptation is represented by diverse functional pathways. Finally, we found that mobile genetic elements bore specificity determinants. In particular, prophages were mainly associated with factors related to humans, while genetic islands-with insects and plants, respectively. In summary, functional enrichments coupled with pangenomic inferences allowed us to hypothesize that the respective host preference is carried out through distinct molecular mechanisms of virulence. To the best of our knowledge, the presented research is the first to identify specific genomic features of S. marcescens assemblies isolated from different hosts at the pangenomic level.",pangenome

Here, we report high-quality gene-based and SV-based pangenomes comprising 22 hexaploid wheat assemblies showing a wide range of chromosome size, gene number, and TE component, which indicates their representativeness of wheat genetic diversity. Pan-gene analyses uncover 140,261 distinct gene families, of which only 23.2% are shared in all accessions. Moreover, we built a ∼16.15 Gb graph pangenome containing 695,897 bubbles, intersecting 5,132 genes and 230,307 cis-regulatory regions. Pairwise genome comparisons identified ∼1,978,221 non-redundant SVs and 497 SV hotspots. Notably, the density of bubbles as well as SVs show remarkable aggregation in centromeres, which probably play an important role in chromosome plasticity and stability. As for functional SVs exploration, we identify 2,769 SVs with absolute relative frequency differences exceeding 0.7 between spring and winter growth habit groups. Additionally, several reported functional genes in wheat display complex structural graphs, for example PPD-A1, VRT-A2, and TaNAAT2-A.

Due to a pangenome graph's potential excessive size, this is a significant challenge. In response, we introduce a novel graph layout algorithm: the Path-Guided Stochastic Gradient Descent (PG-SGD). PG-SGD uses the genomes, represented in the pangenome graph as paths, as an embedded positional system to sample genomic distances between pairs of nodes. This avoids the quadratic cost seen in previous versions of graph drawing by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We show that our implementation efficiently computes the low dimensional layouts of gigabase-scale pangenome graphs, unveiling their biological features.

Aligning sequences to a graph is critical for pangenome-based resequencing. The seed-chain-extend heuristic works by finding short exact matches between a sequence and a graph. In this heuristic, colinear chaining helps identify a good cluster of exact matches that can be combined to form an alignment. Colinear chaining algorithms have been extensively studied for aligning two sequences with various gap costs, including linear, concave, and convex cost functions. However, extending these algorithms for sequence-to-graph alignment presents significant challenges. Recently, Makinen et al. introduced a sparse dynamic programming framework that exploits the small path cover property of acyclic pangenome graphs, enabling efficient chaining. However, this framework does not consider gap costs, limiting its practical effectiveness. We address this limitation by developing novel problem formulations and provably good chaining algorithms that support a variety of gap cost functions. These functions are carefully designed to enable fast chaining algorithms whose time requirements are parameterized in terms of the size of the minimum path cover. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared with existing aligners.

Moreover, a section-wide gene repertoire was constructed, which indicated that core genes were more evolutionarily conserved than variable genes. Subsequently, we identified 546,137 SVs, their enrichment regions, and relationships with genomic features and found significant divergence across Eurasian pigs. More importantly, the pangenome-detected SVs could complement heritability estimates and genome-wide association studies based only on single nucleotide polymorphisms. Among the SVs shaped by selection, we identified an insertion in the promoter region of the TBX19 gene, which may be related to the development, growth, and timidity traits of Asian pigs and may affect the gene expression.

Since the late 1970s, the lake has undergone increasing eutrophication pressure, due to wastewater input, leading to the occurrence of frequent cyanobacterial blooms. The major difference observed between PAMP2011 and PAMP2012 MAGs was the lack of the saxitoxin gene cluster in PAMP2012, which also presented a smaller genome, while PAMP2011 presented the complete sxt cluster and all essential proteins and clusters. The pangenome analysis was performed with all Raphidiopsis/Cylindrospermopsis genomes available at NCBI to date, with the addition of PAMP2011 and PAMP2012 MAGs (All33 subset), but also without the South American strains (noSA subset), and only among the South American strains (SA10 and SA8 subsets). We observed a substantial increase in the core genome size for the 'noSA' subset, in comparison to 'All33' subset, and since the core genome reflects the closeness among the pangenome members, the results strongly suggest that the conservation level of the essential gene repertoire seems to be affected by the geographic origin of the strains being analyzed, supporting the existence of a distinct SA clade. The Raphidiopsis pangenome comprised a total of 7943 orthologous protein clusters, and the two new MAGs increased the pangenome size by 11%. The pangenome based phylogenetic relationships among the 33 analyzed genomes showed that the SA genomes clustered together with 99% bootstrap support, reinforcing the metabolic particularity of the Raphidiopsis South American clade, related to its saxitoxin producing unique ability, while also indicating a different evolutionary history due to its geographic isolation.",pangenome

ASE was observed for close to 6000 genes in both hybrid cultivars. A subset of ASE genes related to aspects of fruit quality such as sugars, organic acids, and cuticular wax were identified, suggesting their important contributions to heterosis. Specifically, Ma1, a gene regulating fruit acidity, is absent in the paternal haplotypes of HXS and YLX. A pangenome graph was built based on our assemblies and seven published pear genomes. Resequencing data for 139 cultivated pear genotypes (including 97 genotypes sequenced here) were subsequently aligned to the pangenome graph, revealing numerous structural variant hotspots and selective sweeps during pear diversification. As predicted, the Ma1 allele was found to be absent in varieties with low organic acid content, and this association was functionally validated by Ma1 overexpression in pear fruit and calli. Overall, these results reveal the contributions of ASE to fruit-quality heterosis and provide a robust pangenome reference for high-resolution allele discovery and association mapping.",pangenome

Our k-mer indexing approach enabled us to identify a valuable collection of universally conserved sequences across all assemblies, referred to as ""pan-conserved segment tags"" (PSTs). By examining intervals between these segments, we discerned highly conserved genomic segments and those with structurally related polymorphisms. We found 60,764 polymorphic intervals with unique geo-ethnic features in the pangenome reference.

In the era of next-generation sequencing, thousands of strains from this genus have now been sequenced as part of isolated studies that focus on outbreak characterization, host range, diversity, and virulence factor identification. However, these data have not been synthesized and we lack a comprehensive phylogeny for the genus, with some species designations in public databases still relying on phenotypic similarities and representative sequence typing. The extent of genetic cohesiveness among Xanthomonas strains, the distribution of virulence factors across strains, and the impact of evolutionary history on host range across the genus are also poorly understood. In this study, we present a pangenome analysis of 1,910 diverse Xanthomonas genomes, highlighting their evolutionary relationships, the distribution of virulence-associated genes across strains, and rates of horizontal gene transfer. We find a number of broadly conserved classes of virulence factors and considerable diversity in the Type 3 Secretion Systems (T3SSs) and Type 3 Secreted Effector (T3SE) repertoires of different Xanthomonas species. We also use these data to re-assign incorrectly classified strains to phylogenetically informed species designations and find evidence of both monophyletic host specificity and convergent evolution of phylogenetically distant strains to the same host. Finally, we explore the role of recombination in maintaining genetic cohesion within the Xanthomonas genus as a result of both ancestral and recent recombination events. Understanding the evolutionary history of Xanthomonas species and the relationship of key virulence factors with host-specificity provides valuable insight into the mechanisms through which Xanthomonas species shift between hosts and will enable us to develop more robust resistance strategies against these highly virulent pathogens.",pangenome

Despite extensive knowledge of virulence mechanisms, understanding the factors driving host specificity remains limited. In this study, we performed a comprehensive pangenome-wide analysis of S. enterica to identify potential loci determining preference towards certain hosts. We used a dataset of high-quality genome assemblies grouped into 300 reference clusters with a special focus on four host groups: humans, pigs, cattle, and birds. The reconstructed pangenome was shown to be open and enriched with the accessory component implying high genetic diversity. Notably, phylogenetic inferences did not correspond to the distribution of affected hosts, as large compact phylogenetic groups were absent. By performing a pangenome-wide association study, we identified potential host specificity determinants. These included multiple genes encoding proteins involved in distinct infection stages, e.g., secretion systems, surface structures, transporters, transcription regulators, etc. We also identified antibiotic resistance loci in host-adapted strains. Functional annotation corroborated the results obtained with significant enrichments related to stress response, antibiotic resistance, ion transport, and surface or extracellular localization.

The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) does not have significant efficacy against serotype 3 despite polysaccharide inclusion in the vaccine. It was hypothesized that PCV13 may effectively control Clade I of CC180 but that Clades III and IV are resistant, provoking a population shift that enables serotype 3 persistence. This has been observed in the United States, England, and Wales but not Spain. We tested this hypothesis further utilizing a dataset from Portugal. Methods We whole-genome sequenced (WGS) 501 serotype 3 strains from Portugal isolated from patients with pneumococcal infections between 1999-2020. The draft genomes underwent phylogenetic analyses, pangenome profiling, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We also completed antibiotic susceptibility testing and compiled over 2,600 serotype 3 multilocus sequence type 180 (MLST180) WGSs to perform global comparative genomics. Findings CC180 Clades I, II, III, IV, and VI distributions were similar when comparing non-invasive pneumonia isolates and invasive disease isolates (Fisher's exact test, P=0.29), and adult and pediatric cases (Fisher's exact test, P=0.074). The serotype 3 CCs shifted post-PCV13 (Fisher's exact test, P<0.0001) and Clade I became dominant. Clade I is largely antibiotic-sensitive and carries the phiOXC141 prophage but the pangenome is heterogenous. Strains from Portugal and Spain, where Clade I remains dominant post-PCV13, have larger pangenomes and are associated with the presence of two genes encoding hypothetical proteins. Interpretation Clade I became dominant in Portugal post-PCV13, despite the burden of the prophage and antibiotic sensitivity. The accessory genome content may mitigate these fitness costs. Regional differences in Clade I prevalence and pangenome heterogeneity suggest that clade dynamics is not a generalizable approach to understanding serotype 3 vaccine escape.

However, the patterns and mechanisms of prokaryote diversification have received relatively little attention compared to animals and plants. Adaptive radiation, the rapid diversification of an ancestor species into multiple ecologically divergent species, is a fundamental process by which macrobiological diversity is generated. Here, we discuss whether ecological opportunity could lead to similar bursts of diversification in bacteria. We explore how adaptive radiations in prokaryotes can be kickstarted by horizontally acquired key innovations allowing lineages to invade new niche space that subsequently is partitioned among diversifying specialist descendants. We discuss how novel adaptive zones are colonized and exploited after the evolution of a key innovation and whether certain types of are more prone to adaptive radiation. Radiation into niche specialists does not necessarily lead to speciation in bacteria when barriers to recombination are absent. We propose that in this scenario, niche-specific genes could accumulate within a single lineage, leading to the evolution of an open pangenome.",pangenome

Our study utilised AMR gene, pangenomic, and predicted plasmid features from 647 Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis genomes across the One Health continuum, along with corresponding resistance phenotypes, to develop interpretive ML classifiers. Vancomycin resistance could be predicted with 99% accuracy with AMR gene features, 98% with pangenome features, and 96% with plasmid clusters. Top pangenome features overlapped with the resistance genes of the vanA operon, which are often laterally transmitted via plasmids. Doxycycline resistance prediction achieved approximately 92% accuracy with pangenome features, with the top feature being elements of Tn916 conjugative transposon, a tet(M) carrier. Erythromycin resistance prediction models achieved about 90% accuracy, but top features were negatively correlated with resistance due to the confounding effect of population structure. This work demonstrates the importance of reviewing ML models' features to discern biological relevance even when achieving high-performance metrics.

Moreover, its increasing demand makes it critical to improve nutraceutical, traits and yield. In this review, bioactive compounds accumulated in buckwheat were comprehensively evaluated according to their chemical structure, properties, and physiological function. Biosynthetic pathways of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and fagopyrin were methodically summarized, with the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis. Although there are classic synthesis pathways presented in the previous research, the metabolic flow of how these certain compounds are being synthesized in buckwheat still remains uncovered.

While large-scale metagenomic assembly efforts have made pangenome estimates more complete, mixed communities can also introduce contamination into assemblies, and it is unknown how robust pangenome-based metagenomic analyses are to these errors.

Our results demonstrate that even small amounts of contamination in metagenome assemblies, below typical quality thresholds, can threaten to overwhelm gene-level metagenomic analyses. However, we also show that such contaminants can be accurately identified using a method based on gene-to-species correlation. After removing these contaminants, we observe that several flagellar motility gene clusters in the Lachnospira eligens pangenome are associated with cirrhosis status. We have integrated our analyses into an analysis and visualization pipeline, PanSweep, that can automatically identify cases where pangenome contamination may bias the results of gene-resolved analyses. Metagenome-assembled genomes, or MAGs, can be constructed without pure cultures of microbes. Large scale efforts to build MAGs have yielded more complete pangenomes (i.e., sets of all genes found in one species). Pangenomes allow us to measure strain variation in gene content, which can strongly affect phenotype. However, because MAGs come from mixed communities, they can contaminate pangenomes with unrelated DNA, and how much this impacts downstream analyses has not been studied. Using a metagenomic study of gut microbes in cirrhosis as our test case, we investigate how contamination affects analyses of microbial gene content. Surprisingly, even small, typical amounts of MAG contamination (<5%) result in disproportionately high levels of false positive associations (38%). Fortunately, we show that most contaminants can be automatically flagged, and provide a simple method for doing so. Furthermore, applying this method reveals a new association between cirrhosis and gut microbial motility.",pangenome

In addition, Paracoccus is taxonomically, metabolically and regarding lifestyle highly diverse. Until now, little is known on how Paracoccus can adapt to such a range of different ecological niches and lifestyles. In the present study, the genus Paracoccus was phylogenomically analyzed (n = 160) and revisited, allowing species level classification of 16 so far unclassified Paracoccus sp. strains and detection of five misclassifications. Moreover, we performed pan-genome analysis of Paracoccus-type strains, isolated from a variety of ecological niches, including different soils, tidal flat sediment, host association such as the bluespotted cornetfish, Bugula plumosa, and the reef-building coral Stylophora pistillata to elucidate either i) the importance of lifestyle and adaptation potential, and ii) the role of the genomic equipment and niche adaptation potential. Six complete genomes were de novo hybrid assembled using a combination of short and long-read technologies. These Paracoccus genomes increase the number of completely closed high-quality genomes of type strains from 15 to 21. Pan-genome analysis revealed an open pan-genome composed of 13,819 genes with a minimal chromosomal core (8.84%) highlighting the genomic adaptation potential and the huge impact of extra-chromosomal elements. All genomes are shaped by the acquisition of various mobile genetic elements including genomic islands, prophages, transposases, and insertion sequences emphasizing their genomic plasticity. In terms of lifestyle, each mobile genetic elements should be evaluated separately with respect to the ecological context. Free-living genomes, in contrast to host-associated, tend to comprise (1) larger genomes, or the highest number of extra-chromosomal elements, (2) higher number of genomic islands and insertion sequence elements, and (3) a lower number of intact prophage regions. Regarding lifestyle adaptations, free-living genomes share genes linked to genetic exchange via T4SS, especially relevant for Paracoccus, known for their numerous extrachromosomal elements, enabling adaptation to dynamic environments. Conversely, host-associated genomes feature diverse genes involved in molecule transport, cell wall modification, attachment, stress protection, DNA repair, carbon, and nitrogen metabolism. Due to the vast number of adaptive genes, Paracoccus can quickly adapt to changing environmental conditions.",pangenome

We create multi-species super-pangenomes using pggb, cactus, and minigraph with the Bos taurus taurus reference sequence and eleven haplotype-resolved assemblies from taurine and indicine cattle, bison, yak, and gaur. We recover 221 k nonredundant structural variations (SVs) from the pangenomes, of which 135 k (61%) are common to all three. SVs derived from assembly-based calling show high agreement with the consensus calls from the pangenomes (96%), but validate only a small proportion of variations private to each graph. Pggb and cactus, which also incorporate base-level variation, have approximately 95% exact matches with assembly-derived small variant calls, which significantly improves the edit rate when realigning assemblies compared to minigraph. We use the three pangenomes to investigate 9566 variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), finding 63% have identical predicted repeat counts in the three graphs, while minigraph can over or underestimate the count given its approximate coordinate system. We examine a highly variable VNTR locus and show that repeat unit copy number impacts the expression of proximal genes and non-coding RNA. Our findings indicate good consensus between the three pangenome methods but also show their individual strengths and weaknesses that need to be considered when analysing different types of variants from multiple input assemblies.",pangenome

When mapping reads to a pangenome graph, prioritizing alignments that are consistent with the known haplotypes improves genotyping accuracy. However, the existing rigorous formulations for colinear chaining and alignment problems do not consider the haplotype paths in a pangenome graph. This often leads to spurious read alignments to those paths that are unlikely recombinations of the known haplotypes. In this paper, we develop novel formulations and algorithms for sequence-to-graph alignment and chaining problems. Inspired by the genotype imputation models, we assume that a query sequence is an imperfect mosaic of reference haplotypes. Accordingly, we introduce a recombination penalty in the scoring functions for each haplotype switch. First, we solve haplotype-aware sequence-to-graph alignment in [Formula: see text] time, where Q is the query sequence, E is the set of edges, and H is the set of haplotypes represented in the graph. To complement our solution, we prove that an algorithm significantly faster than [Formula: see text] is impossible under the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH). Second, we propose a haplotype-aware chaining algorithm that runs in [Formula: see text] time after graph preprocessing, where N is the count of input anchors. We then establish that a chaining algorithm significantly faster than [Formula: see text] is impossible under SETH. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented our chaining algorithm in the Minichain aligner. By aligning sequences sampled from the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to a pangenome graph of 60 MHC haplotypes, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better consistency with ground-truth recombinations compared with a haplotype-agnostic algorithm.",pangenome

Many species in the genus have been isolated and characterized. However, few studies have focused on marine isolates or fish pathogens, and in-depth genomic analyses, particularly comparative analyses of isolates from different habitat types, are lacking. Here, we isolated 20 strains of the genus from various environments in South Korea and sequenced their full-length genomes. Combined with published sequence data, we examined genomic traits, evolution, environmental adaptation, and putative metabolic functions in total 187 genomes of isolated species in Flavobacterium categorized as marine, host-associated, and terrestrial including freshwater. A pangenome analysis revealed a correlation between genome size and coding or noncoding density. Flavobacterium spp. had high levels of diversity, allowing for novel gene repertories via recombination events. Defense-related genes only accounted for approximately 3% of predicted genes in all Flavobacterium genomes. While genes involved in metabolic pathways did not differ with respect to isolation source, there was substantial variation in genomic traits; in particular, the abundances of tRNAs and rRNAs were higher in the host-associdated group than in other groups. One genome in the host-associated group contained a Microviridae prophage closely related to an enterobacteria phage. The proteorhodopsin gene was only identified in four terrestrial strains isolated for this study. Furthermore, recombination events clearly influenced genomic diversity and may contribute to the response to environmental stress. These findings shed light on the high genetic variation in Flavobacterium and functional roles in diverse ecosystems as a result of their metabolic versatility. IMPORTANCE The genus Flavobacterium is a diverse group of bacteria that are found in a variety of environments. While most species of this genus are harmless and utilize organic substrates such as proteins and polysaccharides, some members may play a significant role in the cycling for organic substances within their environments. Nevertheless, little is known about the genomic dynamics and/or metabolic capacity of Flavobacterium. Here, we found that Flavobacterium species may have an open pangenome, containing a variety of diverse and novel gene repertoires. Intriguingly, we discovered that one genome (classified into host-associated group) contained a Microviridae prophage closely related to that of enterobacteria. Proteorhodopsin may be expressed under conditions of light or oxygen pressure in some strains isolated for this study. Our findings significantly contribute to the understanding of the members of the genus Flavobacterium diversity exploration and will provide a framework for the way for future ecological characterizations.",pangenome

In this work, the pan-genome of Ligilactobacillus aviarius was explored to describe the functional adaptability to the gastrointestinal environment. The core genome is composed of 1179 gene clusters that are present at least in one copy that codifies to structural, ribosomal and biogenesis proteins.

A systematic analysis characterizing the genomic determinants of extra-intestinal pathogenic vs. commensal isolates in human populations, which could inform mechanisms of pathogenesis, diagnostic, prevention and treatment is still lacking. We used a collection of 912 BSI and 370 commensal E. coli isolates collected in France over a 17-year period (2000-2017). We compared their pangenomes, genetic backgrounds (phylogroups, STs, O groups), presence of virulence-associated genes (VAGs) and antimicrobial resistance genes, finding significant differences in all comparisons between commensal and BSI isolates. A machine learning linear model trained on all the genetic variants derived from the pangenome and controlling for population structure reveals similar differences in VAGs, discovers new variants associated with pathogenicity (capacity to cause BSI), and accurately classifies BSI vs. commensal strains. Pathogenicity is a highly heritable trait, with up to 69% of the variance explained by bacterial genetic variants. Lastly, complementing our commensal collection with an older collection from 1980, we predict that pathogenicity continuously increased through 1980, 2000, to 2010. Together our findings imply that E. coli exhibit substantial genetic variation contributing to the transition between commensalism and pathogenicity and that this species evolved towards higher pathogenicity.",pangenome

It has over 100 wild relatives in the Solanum section Petota, which features species with both sexual and asexual reproduction and varying ploidy levels. A pangenome of Solanum section Petota composed of 296 accessions was constructed including diploids and polyploids compared via presence/absence variation (PAV). The Petota core (genes shared by at least 97% of the accessions) and shell genomes (shared by 3 to 97%) are enriched in basic molecular and cellular functions, while the cloud genome (genes present in less than 3% of the member accessions) showed enrichment in transposable elements (TEs). Comparison of PAV in domesticated vs. wild accessions was made, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on PAVs, grouping accessions into different clades, similar to previous phylogenies produced using DNA markers. A cladewise pangenome approach identified abiotic stress response among the core genes in clade 1+2 and clade 3, and flowering/tuberization among the core genes in clade 4. The TE content differed between the clades, with clade 1+2, which is composed of species from North and Central America with reproductive isolation from species in other clades, having much lower TE content compared to other clades. In contrast, accessions with in vitro propagation history were identified and found to have high levels of TEs. Results indicate a role for TEs in adaptation to new environments, both natural and artificial, for Solanum section Petota.",pangenome

Here, we performed comparative genomic analyses of P.b and compared their pan-genomic features and virulence coding profiles to those of P.s. Our results revealed that P.b has a more plastic pangenome, a larger genome size, and a higher GC content than P.s. Interestingly, the P.b and P.s share similar core-genomic functions, but P.b encodes more functions in nutrient metabolism and energy conversion and fewer functions in host defense in their accessory-genomes. The P.b may initiate extracellular infection processes similar to those of P.s and Clostridium perfringens by encoding three toxin homologs (i.e., microbial collagenase, thiol-activated cytolysin, phospholipase C, which are involved in extracellular matrices degradation and membrane damaging) in their core-genomes. However, P.b is less toxic than the P.s by encoding fewer secretion toxins in the core-genome and fewer lethal toxins in the accessory-genome. Notably, P.b carries more toxins genes in their accessory-genomes, particularly those of plasmid origin. Moreover, three within-species and highly conserved plasmid groups, encoding virulence, gene acquisition, and adaptation, were carried by 25-33% of P.b strains and clustered by isolation source rather than geography. This study characterized the pan-genomic virulence features of P.b for the first time, and revealed that P. bifermentans is an emerging pathogen that can threaten human health in many aspects, emphasizing the importance of phenotypic and genomic characterizations of in situ clinical isolates.",pangenome

Until today, it is a moot point whether there are C. acnes strains exclusively devoted to be part of the skin microbiome and others, that carry special features enabling them to cause disease. So far, the search for the molecular background of such diverse behavior has led to inconsistent results. In the present study, we prospectively collected C. acnes strains from 27 infected persons and 18 healthy controls employing rigid selection criteria to ensure their role as infectious agent or colonizer. The genome sequences from these strains were obtained and carefully controlled for quality. Deduced traditional phylotyping assigned almost all superficial isolates to type IA1, while the clinical strains were evenly distributed between types IA1, IB, and II. Single locus sequence typing (SLST) showed a predominance of A1 type for the control strains, whereas 56% of the clinical isolates belonged to types A1, H1 and K8. Pangenome analysis from all the present strains and 30 published genomes indicated the presence of an open pangenome. Except for three isolates, the colonizing strains clustered in clades separate from the majority of clinical strains, while 4 clinical strains clustered with the control strains. Identical results were obtained by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. However, there were no significant differences in virulence gene contents in both groups. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from both the pangenome and SNP data consistently showed genomic differences between both groups located in metabolic pathway and DNA repair genes. Thus, the different behavior of colonizing and infectious C. acnes strains could be due to special metabolic capacities or flexibilities rather than specific virulence traits.",pangenome

The pangenome, a comprehensive genetic pool encompassing all variations within a species, serves as an invaluable tool, unaffected by the confounding factors of intraspecific diversity. This allows for a more nuanced exploration of plant TE evolution. Here, we constructed a pangenome for diploid A-genome cotton using 344 accessions from representative geographical regions, including 223 from China as the main component. We found 511 Mb of non-reference sequences (NRSs) and revealed the presence of 5479 previously undiscovered protein-coding genes. Our comprehensive approach enabled us to decipher the genetic underpinnings of the distinct geographic distributions of cotton. Notably, we identified 3301 presence-absence variations (PAVs) that are closely tied to gene expression patterns within the pangenome, among which 2342 novel expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) were found residing in NRSs. Our investigation also unveiled contrasting patterns of transposon proliferation between diploid and tetraploid cotton, with long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons exhibiting a synchronized surge in polyploids. Furthermore, the invasion of LTR retrotransposons from the A subgenome to the D subgenome triggered a substantial expansion of the latter following polyploidization. In addition, we found that TE insertions were responsible for the loss of 36.2% of species-specific genes, as well as the generation of entirely new species-specific genes. Our pangenome analyses provide new insights into cotton genomics and subgenome dynamics after polyploidization and demonstrate the power of pangenome approaches for elucidating transposon impacts and genome evolution.",pangenome

However, its host range is much broader. It causes diseases of sunflower, potato, tomato, carrots, sweet potato, radish, squash, cucumber, and chrysanthemum. To explain this phenomenon, a comprehensive pathogenomic and phenomic characterisation of P. betavasculorum species was performed. Genomes of P. betavasculorum strains isolated from potato, sunflower, and artichoke were sequenced and compared with those from sugar beet isolates. Metabolic profiling and pathogenomic analyses were conducted to assess virulence determinants and adaptation potential. Pathogenicity assays were performed on potato tubers and chicory leaves to confirm in silico predictions of disease symptoms. Phenotypic assays were also conducted to assess the strains ability to synthesise homoserine lactones and siderophores. The genome size ranged from 4.675 to 4.931 kbp, and GC % was between 51.0% and 51.2%. The pangenome of P. betavasculorum is open and comprises, on average, 4,220 gene families. Of these, 83% of genes are the core genome, and 2% of the entire pangenome are unique genes. Strains isolated from sugar beet have a smaller pangenome size and a higher number of unique genes than those from other plants. Interestingly, genomes of strains from artichoke and sunflower share 391 common CDS that are not present in the genomes of other strains from sugar beet or potato. Those strains have only one unique gene. All strains could use numerous sugars as building materials and energy sources and possessed a high repertoire of virulence determinants in the genomes. P. betavasculorum strains were able to cause disease symptoms on potato tubers and chicory leaves. They were also able to synthesise homoserine lactones and siderophores. The findings underscore the adaptability of P. betavasculorum to diverse hosts and environments. Strains adapted to plants with high sugar content in tissues have a different composition of fatty acids in membranes and a different mechanism of replenishing nitrogen in case of deficiency of this compound than strains derived from other plant species. Extensive phenomics and genomic analyses performed in this study have shown that P. betavasculorum species is an agronomically relevant pathogen.",pangenome

Algal-bacterial interactions are crucial for maintaining ecosystem balance and elemental cycling, but their response to BHT remains to be investigated. This study analyzed the physiological and biochemical responses of the microalga Isochrysis galbana and the changes of associated bacterial communities under different concentrations of BHT stress. Results showed that the biomass of I. galbana exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing BHT concentrations up to 40 mg/L. The reduction in chlorophyll, carotenoid, and soluble protein content of microalgal cells was also observed under BHT stress. The production of malondialdehyde and the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase were further determined. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that BHT caused surface rupture of the algal cells and loss of intracellular nutrients. Proteomic analysis demonstrated the upregulation of photosynthesis and citric acid cycle pathways as a response to BHT stress. Additionally, BHT significantly increased the relative abundance of specific bacteria in the phycosphere, including Marivita, Halomonas, Marinobacter, and Alteromonas. Further experiments confirmed that these bacteria had the ability to utilize BHT as the sole carbon resource for growth, and genes related to the degradation of phenolic compounds were detected through pangenome analysis.",pangenome

The yeast Torulaspora delbrueckii is gaining importance for biotechnology but little is known about its population structure, variation in gene content or possible domestication routes. Here, we show that T. delbrueckii is composed of five major clades. Among the three European clades, a lineage associated with the wild arboreal niche is sister to the two other lineages that are linked to anthropic environments, one to wine fermentations and the other to diverse sources including dairy products and bread dough (Mix-Anthropic clade). Using 64 genomes we assembled the pangenome and the variable genome of T. delbrueckii. A comparison with Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that the weight of the variable genome in the pangenome of T. delbrueckii is considerably smaller. An association of gene content and ecology supported the hypothesis that the Mix-Anthropic clade has the most specialized genome and indicated that some of the exclusive genes were implicated in galactose and maltose utilization. More detailed analyses traced the acquisition of a cluster of GAL genes in strains associated with dairy products and the expansion and functional diversification of MAL genes in strains isolated from bread dough. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, domestication in T. delbrueckii is not primarily driven by alcoholic fermentation but rather by adaptation to dairy and bread-production niches. This study expands our views on the processes of microbe domestication and on the trajectories leading to adaptation to anthropic niches.",pangenome

The problem requires the calculation of sequence homology among such genes. When combined with metagenomics, namely for human microbiome composition analysis, gene-oriented pangenome detection becomes a promising method to decipher ecosystem functions and population-level evolution. Established computational tools are able to investigate the genetic content of isolates for which a complete genomic sequence is available. However, there is a plethora of incomplete genomes that are available on public resources, which only a few tools may analyze. Incomplete means that the process for reconstructing their genomic sequence is not complete, and only fragments of their sequence are currently available.

In this study, we conducted a metapangenomic analysis of oral Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species to uncover genomic diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and habitat specialization within the human oral cavity. Using three metrics-pangenomic gene content, phylogenomics, and average nucleotide identity (ANI)-we first identified distinct species and sub-species groups among these genera. Mapping of metagenomic reads then revealed clear patterns of habitat specialization, such as Aggregatibacter species predominantly in dental plaque, a distinctive Haemophilus parainfluenzae sub-species group on the tongue dorsum, and H. sp. HMT-036 predominantly in keratinized gingiva and buccal mucosa. In addition, we found that supragingival plaque samples contained predominantly only one out of the three taxa, H. parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, and A. sp. HMT-458, suggesting independent niches or a competitive relationship. Functional analyses revealed the presence of key metabolic genes, such as oxaloacetate decarboxylase, correlated with habitat specialization, suggesting metabolic versatility as a driving force. Additionally, heme synthesis distinguishes H. sp. HMT-036 from closely related Haemophilus haemolyticus, suggesting that the availability of micronutrients, particularly iron, was important in the evolutionary ecology of these species. Overall, our study exemplifies the power of metapangenomics to identify factors that may affect ecological interactions within microbial communities, including genomic diversity, habitat specialization, and metabolic versatility. Understanding the microbial ecology of the mouth is essential for comprehending human physiology. This study employs metapangenomics to reveal that various Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species exhibit distinct ecological preferences within the oral cavity of healthy individuals, thereby supporting the site-specialist hypothesis.

In contrast to common resequencing studies that compare whole genome sequencing data with a single reference genome, the construction of a pan-genome (PG) involves the direct comparison of multiple genomes to one another, thereby enabling the detection of genomic sequences and genes not present in the reference, as well as the analysis of gene content diversity. Although multiple studies describing PGs of various plant species have been published in recent years, a better understanding regarding the effect of the computational procedures used for PG construction could guide researchers in making more informed methodological decisions. Here, we examine the effect of several key methodological factors on the obtained gene pool and on gene presence-absence detections by constructing and comparing multiple PGs of Arabidopsis thaliana and cultivated soybean, as well as conducting a meta-analysis on published PGs. These factors include the construction method, the sequencing depth, and the extent of input data used for gene annotation. We observe substantial differences between PGs constructed using three common procedures (de novo assembly and annotation, map-to-pan, and iterative assembly) and that results are dependent on the extent of the input data. Specifically, we report low agreement between the gene content inferred using different procedures and input data. Our results should increase the awareness of the community to the consequences of methodological decisions made during the process of PG construction and emphasize the need for further investigation of commonly applied methodologies.",pangenome

Although phage therapy is one of promising strategies for dealing with MDR bacteria, the main challenges of phage therapeutics include accumulation of phage resistant mutations and acquisition of the phage defense systems. To systematically evaluate the impact of (pro)phages in shaping genetic and evolutionary diversity of S. maltophilia, we collected 166 S. maltophilia isolates from three hospitals in southern China to analyze its pangenome, virulence factors, prophage regions, and anit-viral immune systems. Pangenome analysis indicated that there are 1328 saturated core genes and 26961 unsaturated accessory genes in the pangenome, suggesting existence of highly variable parts of S. maltophilia genome. The presence of genes in relation to T3SS and T6SS mechanisms suggests the great potential to secrete toxins by the S. maltophilia population, which is contrary to the conventional notion of low-virulence of S. maltophilia. Additionally, we characterized the pan-immune system maps of these clinical isolates against phage infections and revealed the co-harboring of CBASS and anti-CBASS in some strains, suggesting a never-ending arms race and the co-evolutionary dynamic between bacteria and phages. Furthermore, our study predicted 310 prophage regions in S. maltophilia with high genetic diversity.

However, these methods have limitations, potentially resulting in imprecise predictions owing to incomplete coverage of AMR mechanisms and genetic variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a pan-genome-based machine learning approach to advance our understanding of AMR gene repertoires and uncover possible feature sets for precise AMR classification. By building compacted de Brujin graphs (cDBGs) from thousands of genomes and collecting the presence/absence patterns of unique sequences (unitigs) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we determined that using machine learning models on unitig-centered pan-genomes showed significant promise for accurately predicting the antibiotic resistance or susceptibility of microbial strains. Applying a feature-selection-based machine learning algorithm led to satisfactory predictive performance for the training dataset (with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of > 0.929) and an independent validation dataset (AUC, approximately 0.77). Furthermore, the selected unitigs revealed previously unidentified resistance genes, allowing for the expansion of the resistance gene repertoire to those that have not previously been described in the literature on antibiotic resistance. These results demonstrate that our proposed unitig-based pan-genome feature set was effective in constructing machine learning predictors that could accurately identify AMR pathogens. Gene sets extracted using this approach may offer valuable insights into expanding known AMR genes and forming new hypotheses to uncover the underlying mechanisms of bacterial AMR.",pangenome

Infections by the Borreliaceae are difficult to detect by both direct and indirect methods, often leading to delayed and missed diagnoses. Efforts to improve diagnoses center around the development of molecular diagnostics (MDx), but due to deep tissue sequestration of the causative spirochaetes and the lack of persistent bacteremias, even MDx assays suffer from a lack of sensitivity. Additionally, the highly extensive genomic heterogeneity among isolates, even within the same species, contributes to the lack of assay sensitivity as single target assays cannot provide universal coverage. This within-species heterogeneity is partly due to differences in replicon repertoires and genomic structures that have likely arisen to support the complex Borreliaceae lifecycle in which these parasites have to survive in multiple hosts each with unique immune responses. We constructed a Borreliaceae family-level pangenome and characterized the phylogenetic relationships among the constituent taxa which supports the recent taxonomy of splitting the family into at least two genera. Gene content pro les were created for the majority of the Borreliaceae replicons, providing for the first time their unambiguous molecular typing. Our characterization of the Borreliaceae pan-genome supports the splitting of the former Borrelia genus into two genera and provides for the phylogenetic placement of several non-species designated isolates.

We review the role of SVs in shaping phenotypes in avian model systems, and identify some general patterns in SV type, length and their associated traits. We found that most of the avian SVs so far identified are short indels in chickens, which are frequently associated with changes in body weight and plumage colouration. Overall, we found that relatively short SVs are more frequently detected, likely due to a combination of their prevalence compared to large SVs, and a detection bias, stemming primarily from the widespread use of short-read sequencing and associated analytical methods. SVs most commonly involve non-coding regions, especially introns, and when patterns of inheritance were reported, SVs associated primarily with dominant discrete traits. We summarise several examples of phenotypic convergence across different species, mediated by different SVs in the same or different genes and different types of changes in the same gene that can lead to various phenotypes. Complex rearrangements and supergenes, which can simultaneously affect and link several genes, tend to have pleiotropic phenotypic effects. Additionally, SVs commonly co-occur with single-nucleotide polymorphisms, highlighting the need to consider all types of genetic changes to understand the basis of phenotypic traits. We end by summarising expectations for when long-read technologies become commonly implemented in non-model birds, likely leading to an increase in SV discovery and characterisation. The growing interest in this subject suggests an increase in our understanding of the phenotypic effects of SVs in upcoming years.",pangenome

It remains a major public health challenge in the endemic region around the Bay of Bengal. Over decadal time scales, one lineage typically dominates the others and spreads in global pandemic waves. However, it remains unclear to what extent diverse lineages co-circulate during a single outbreak season. Defining the pool of diversity during finer time scales is important because the selective pressures that impact V. cholerae - namely antibiotics and phages - are dynamic on these time scales. To study the nationwide diversity of V. cholerae, we long-read sequenced 273 V. cholerae genomes from seven hospitals over one year (2018) in Bangladesh. Four major V. cholerae lineages were identified: known lineages BD-1, BD-2a, and BD-2b, and a novel lineage that we call BD-3. In 2022, BD-1 caused a large cholera outbreak in Dhaka, apparently outcompeting BD-2 lineages. We show that, in 2018, BD-1 was already dominant in the five northern regions, including Dhaka, consistent with an origin from India in the north. By contrast, we observed a higher diversity of lineages in the two southern regions near the coast. The four lineages differed in pangenome content, including integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) and genes involved in resistance to bacteriophages and antibiotics. Notably, BD-2a lacked an ICE and is predicted to be more sensitive to phages and antibiotics, but nevertheless persisted throughout the year-long sampling period.

Biastools analyzes and categorizes instances of reference bias. It works in various scenarios: when the donor's variants are known and reads are simulated; when donor variants are known and reads are real; and when variants are unknown and reads are real. Using biastools, we observe that more inclusive graph genomes result in fewer biased sites. We find that end-to-end alignment reduces bias at indels relative to local aligners. Finally, we use biastools to characterize how T2T references improve large-scale bias.",pangenome

Recent evidence suggests that lncRNAs may also play roles in virulence, such as regulating pathogenicity-associated enzymes and on-host reproductive cycles. Despite the importance of lncRNAs, only a few model fungi have well-documented inventories of lncRNA. In this study, we apply a recent computational pipeline to predict high-confidence lncRNA candidates in Zymoseptoria tritici, an important global pathogen of wheat impacting global food production. We analyse genomic features of lncRNAs and the most likely associated processes through analyses of expression over a host infection cycle. We find that lncRNAs are frequently expressed during early infection, before the switch to necrotrophic growth. They are mostly located in facultative heterochromatic regions, which are known to contain many genes associated with pathogenicity. Furthermore, we find that lncRNAs are frequently co-expressed with genes that may be involved in responding to host defence signals, such as oxidative stress. Finally, we assess pangenome features of lncRNAs using four additional reference-quality genomes. We find evidence that the repertoire of expressed lncRNAs varies substantially between individuals, even though lncRNA loci tend to be shared at the genomic level. Overall, this study provides a repertoire and putative functions of lncRNAs in Z. tritici enabling future molecular genetics and functional analyses in an important pathogen.",pangenome

Despite the substantial contribution of IGTs to genome variation, the dynamic trajectories of IGTs at the pangenomic level remain elusive. Here, we developed an approach, IGTminer, that maps the evolutionary trajectories of IGTs using collinearity and gene reannotation across multiple genome assemblies. We applied IGTminer to create a nuclear organellar gene (NOG) map across 67 genomes covering 15 Poaceae species, including important crops. The resulting NOGs were verified by experiments and sequencing data sets. Our analysis revealed that most NOGs were recently transferred and lineage specific and that Triticeae species tended to have more NOGs than other Poaceae species. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) had a higher retention rate of NOGs than maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa), and the retained NOGs were likely involved in photosynthesis and translation pathways. Large numbers of NOG clusters were aggregated in hexaploid wheat during 2 rounds of polyploidization, contributing to the genetic diversity among modern wheat accessions. We implemented an interactive web server to facilitate the exploration of NOGs in Poaceae.

Advances in the field of pan genomics would facilitate the understanding of the clinical significance of such bacterial species previously thought to be among commensals paving the way for identifying new drug targets and control strategies. We constructed a pan-genome using 310 genome sequences of C. striatum. Pan-genome analysis was performed using three tools including Roary, PIRATE, and PEPPAN. AMR genes and virulence factors have been studied in relation to core genome phylogeny. Genomic Islands (GIs), Integrons, and Prophage regions have been explored in detail. The pan-genome ranges between a total of 5253-5857 genes with 2070 - 1899 core gene clusters. Some antimicrobial resistance genes have been identified in the core genome portion, but most of them were located in the dispensable genome. In addition, some well-known virulence factors described in pathogenic Corynebacterium species were located in the dispensable genome. A total of 115 phage species have been identified with only 44 intact prophage regions. This study presents a detailed comparative pangenome report of C. striatum. The species show a very slowly growing pangenome with relatively high number of genes in the core genome contributing to lower genomic variation. Prophage elements carrying AMR and virulence elements appear to be infrequent in the species. GIs appear to offer a prominent role in mobilizing antibiotic resistance genes in the species and integrons occur at a frequency of 50% in the species. Control strategies should be directed against virulence and resistance determinants carried on the core genome and those frequently occurring in the accessory genome.",pangenome

The taxonomic complexity and inconsistent nomenclature of Gardnerella have impeded progress in understanding the role of specific species in health and disease. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive genomic and pangenomic analysis to resolve taxonomic ambiguities and elucidate metabolic and virulence potential across Gardnerella species. We obtained complete, closed genomes for 42 Gardnerella isolates from women with BV and curated publicly available genome sequences (n = 291). Average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis, digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), and the cpn60 gene sequences identified nine species and eleven subspecies within Gardnerella , for which we refined species and subspecies boundaries and proposed updated nomenclature. Pangenome analysis revealed species-specific gene clusters linked to metabolic pathways, virulence factors, and niche adaptations, distinguishing species specialized for mucin degradation in the vaginal environment from those potentially adapted to urinary tract colonization. Notably, we identified lineage-specific evolutionary divergence in gene clusters associated with biofilm formation, carbohydrate metabolism, and antimicrobial resistance. We further discovered the first cryptic plasmids naturally present within the Gardnerella genus. Our findings provide a unified framework for Gardnerella taxonomy and nomenclature, and enhance our understanding of species-specific functional capabilities, with implications for Gardnerella research, diagnostics, and targeted therapeutics in BV.",pangenome

A transformative opportunity lies in exchanging genotype-to-phenotype knowledge between major crops (that is, those cultivated globally) and indigenous crops (that is, those locally cultivated within a circumscribed area)3-5 to enhance our food system. However, species-specific genetic variants and their interactions with desirable natural or engineered mutations pose barriers to achieving predictable phenotypic effects, even between related crops6,7. Here, by establishing a pan-genome of the crop-rich genus Solanum8 and integrating functional genomics and pan-genetics, we show that gene duplication and subsequent paralogue diversification are major obstacles to genotype-to-phenotype predictability. Despite broad conservation of gene macrosynteny among chromosome-scale references for 22 species, including 13 indigenous crops, thousands of gene duplications, particularly within key domestication gene families, exhibited dynamic trajectories in sequence, expression and function. By augmenting our pan-genome with African eggplant cultivars9 and applying quantitative genetics and genome editing, we dissected an intricate history of paralogue evolution affecting fruit size. The loss of a redundant paralogue of the classical fruit size regulator CLAVATA3 (CLV3)10,11 was compensated by a lineage-specific tandem duplication. Subsequent pseudogenization of the derived copy, followed by a large cultivar-specific deletion, created a single fused CLV3 allele that modulates fruit organ number alongside an enzymatic gene controlling the same trait. Our findings demonstrate that paralogue diversifications over short timescales are underexplored contingencies in trait evolvability. Exposing and navigating these contingencies is crucial for translating genotype-to-phenotype relationships across species.",pangenome

Recently, a compressed-index data structure called the ""move structure"" was proposed as an alternative to other BWT-based indexes like the FM index and r-index. The move structure uniquely achieves both O(r) space and O(1)-time queries, where r is the number of runs in the pangenome BWT. We implemented Movi, an efficient tool for building and querying move-structure pangenome indexes. While the size of the Movi's index is larger than the r-index, it scales at a smaller rate for pangenome references, as its size is exactly proportional to r, the number of runs in the BWT of the reference. Movi can compute sophisticated matching queries needed for classification - such as pseudo-matching lengths and backward search - at least ten times faster than the fastest available methods, and in some cases more than 30-fold faster. Movi achieves this speed by leveraging the move structure's strong locality of reference, incurring close to the minimum possible number of cache misses for queries against large pangenomes. We achieve still further speed improvements by using memory prefetching to attain a degree of latency hiding that would be difficult with other index structures like the r-index. Movi's fast constant-time query loop makes it well suited to real-time applications like adaptive sampling for nanopore sequencing, where decisions must be made in a small and predictable time interval.",pangenome

Both tandem and segmental duplication events played a significant role in the expansion of the CNL gene family. These genes contain cis-elements related to light, stress, hormone, and development. The analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) revealed that MiCNL proteins interacted with other defense-responsive proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that MiCNL genes play a role in defense mechanisms within the organism.

With applications of modern technologies over the past 30 years, studies of the effects of SA on plant growth, development, and defence have revealed many new research frontiers and continue to deliver surprises. In this review, we provide an update on recent advances in our understanding of SA metabolism, perception, and signal transduction mechanisms in plant immunity. An overarching theme emerges that SA executes its many functions through intricate regulation at multiple steps: SA biosynthesis is regulated both locally and systemically, while its perception occurs through multiple cellular targets, including metabolic enzymes, redox regulators, transcription cofactors, and, most recently, an RNA-binding protein. Moreover, SA orchestrates a complex series of post-translational modifications of downstream signaling components and promotes the formation of biomolecular condensates that function as cellular signalling hubs. SA also impacts wider cellular functions through crosstalk with other plant hormones. Looking into the future, we propose new areas for exploration of SA functions, which will undoubtedly uncover more surprises for many years to come.",plant

Cell walls are dynamic structures whose composition and integrity can be altered in response to environmental challenges and developmental cues. These wall changes are perceived by plant sensors/receptors to trigger adaptative responses during development and upon stress perception. Plant cell wall damage caused by pathogen infection, wounding, or other stresses leads to the release of wall molecules, such as carbohydrates (glycans), that function as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs are perceived by the extracellular ectodomains (ECDs) of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to activate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and disease resistance. Similarly, glycans released from the walls and extracellular layers of microorganisms interacting with plants are recognized as microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by specific ECD-PRRs triggering PTI responses. The number of oligosaccharides DAMPs/MAMPs identified that are perceived by plants has increased in recent years. However, the structural mechanisms underlying glycan recognition by plant PRRs remain limited. Currently, this knowledge is mainly focused on receptors of the LysM-PRR family, which are involved in the perception of various molecules, such as chitooligosaccharides from fungi and lipo-chitooligosaccharides (i.e., Nod/MYC factors from bacteria and mycorrhiza, respectively) that trigger differential physiological responses. Nevertheless, additional families of plant PRRs have recently been implicated in oligosaccharide/polysaccharide recognition. These include receptor kinases (RKs) with leucine-rich repeat and Malectin domains in their ECDs (LRR-MAL RKs), Catharanthus roseus RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1-LIKE group (CrRLK1L) with Malectin-like domains in their ECDs, as well as wall-associated kinases, lectin-RKs, and LRR-extensins. The characterization of structural basis of glycans recognition by these new plant receptors will shed light on their similarities with those of mammalians involved in glycan perception. The gained knowledge holds the potential to facilitate the development of sustainable, glycan-based crop protection solutions.",plant

It highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the colonization mechanisms employed by biocontrol bacteria to enhance their efficacy in plant pathogen control. The present review deals with the in-depth understanding of steps involved in host colonization by biocontrol bacteria. The colonization process starts from the root zone, where biocontrol bacteria establish initial interactions with the plant's root system. Moving beyond the roots, biocontrol bacteria migrate and colonize other plant organs, including stems, leaves, and even flowers. Also, the present review attempts to explore the mechanisms facilitating bacterial movement within the plant such as migrating through interconnected spaces such as vessels or in the apoplast, and applying quorum sensing or extracellular enzymes during colonization and what is needed to establish a long-term association within a plant. The impacts on microbial community dynamics, nutrient cycling, and overall plant health are discussed, emphasizing the intricate relationships between biocontrol bacteria and the plant's microbiome and the benefits to the plant's above-ground parts, the biocontrol 40 bacteria confer.

Plants also assemble and manage mutualistic microbes to enhance Pi uptake, through integrating PSR and immunity signaling. A trade-off between plant growth and defense favors the notion that plants lower a cellular state of immunity to accommodate host-beneficial microbes for nutrition and growth at the cost of infection risk.

We found that the bidirectionality of plant microbiome interactions presents a challenge for genetic studies. Establishing causality is particularly difficult when a plant mutant has both, an altered phenotype and an altered microbiome. Is the mutation directly affecting the microbiome (e.g., through root exudates), which then causes an altered phenotype of the plant and/or is the altered microbiome the consequence of the mutation altering the plant's phenotype (e.g., root architecture)? Here, we put forward that feedback experiments allow to separate cause and effect and furthermore, they are useful for investigating plant interactions with complex microbiomes in natural soils. They especially allow to investigate the plant genetic basis how plants respond to soil microbiomes and we stress that such microbiome feedbacks are understudied compared to the mechanisms contributing to microbiome assembly.

Some pathogens evade PTI using effectors, triggering plants to activate ETI. At the heart of ETI are nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs), which detect specific pathogen effectors and initiate a robust immune response. NLRs, equipped with a nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeats, drive a potent immune reaction starting with pronounced, prolonged cytosolic Ca2+ influx, followed by increased ROS levels. This sequence of events triggers the hypersensitive response-a localized cell death designed to limit pathogen spread. This intricate use of Ca2+ and ROS highlights the crucial role of NLRs in supplementing the absence of an adaptive immune system in plant innate immunity.",plant

During plant-pathogen interactions, lipids play parts in both the preexisting passive defense mechanisms and the pathogen-induced immune responses at the local and systemic levels. They interact with various components of the plant immune network and can modulate plant defense both positively and negatively. Under biotic stress, lipid signaling is mostly associated with oxygenated natural products derived from unsaturated fatty acids, known as oxylipins; among these, jasmonic acid has been of great interest as a specific mediator of plant defense against necrotrophic pathogens. Although numerous studies have documented the contribution of oxylipins and other lipid-derived species in plant immunity, their specific roles in plant-pathogen interactions and their involvement in the signaling network require further elucidation. This review presents the most relevant and recent studies on lipids and lipid-derived signaling molecules involved in plant-pathogen interactions, with the aim of providing a deeper insight into the mechanisms underpinning lipid-mediated regulation of the plant immune system.",plant

Apart from being the organ responsible for nutrient extraction, the haustorial connection is also a highway for various macromolecules, including DNA, proteins, and, apparently, phytopathogens. At least some parasitic plants are considered significant agricultural pests, contributing to enormous yield losses worldwide. Their negative effect is mainly direct, by the exhaustion of host plant fitness and decreasing growth and seed/fruit formation. However, they may pose an additional threat to agriculture by promoting the trans-species dispersion of various pathogens.

Imazethapyr, a widely utilized imidazolinone herbicide, has a long-lasting presence in the soil-plant system and can induce toxicity in non-target plants. However, the effects of imazethapyr on mineral nutrient homeostasis remain poorly comprehended. In this study, Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to concentrations of 4 and 10 μg/L imazethapyr showed noticeable reductions in shoot development and displayed a distinct dark purple color, which is commonly associated with phosphorus (P) deficiency in crops. Additionally, the total P content in both the shoots and roots of Arabidopsis significantly decreased following imazethapyr treatment when compared to the control groups. Through the complementary use of physiological and molecular analyses, we discovered that imazethapyr hinders the abundance and functionality of inorganic phosphorus (Pi) transporters and acid phosphatase. Furthermore, imazethapyr impairs the plant's Pi-deficiency adaptation strategies, such as inhibiting Pi transporter activities and impeding root hair development, which ultimately exacerbate P starvation. These results provide compelling evidence that residues of imazethapyr have the potential to disrupt plant P homeostasis and acquisition strategies. These findings offer valuable insights for risk assessment and highlight the need to reconsider the indiscriminate use of imazethapyr, particularly under specific scenarios such as nutrient deficiency.",plant

In this review, we introduce the response and regulatory role of SL in salt, drought, light, heat, cold and cadmium stresses in plants. This review also discusses how SL alleviate the damage of abiotic stress in plants, furthermore, introducing the mechanisms of SL enhancing plant stress resistance at the genetic level. Under abiotic stress, the exogenous SL analog GR24 can induce the biosynthesis of SL in plants, and endogenous SL can alleviate the damage caused by abiotic stress. SL enhanced the stress resistance of plants by protecting photosynthesis, enhancing the antioxidant capacity of plants and promoting the symbiosis between plants and arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM). SL interact with abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), auxin, cytokinin (CK), jasmonic acid (JA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and other signal molecules to jointly regulate plant stress resistance.

Salt stressors have adverse impacts on the plant's ionic, osmotic, and oxidative balance, as well as numerous physiological functions. Plants have a variety of coping strategies to deal with salt stress, including osmosensing, osmoregulation, ion-homeostasis, increased antioxidant synthesis, and so on. Not only does salt stress cause oxidative stress but also many types of stress do as well, thus plants have an effective antioxidant system to battle the negative effects of excessive reactive oxygen species produced as a result of stress. Rising salinity in the agricultural field affects crop productivity and plant development considerably; nevertheless, plants have a well-known copying mechanism that shields them from salt stress by facilitated production of secondary metabolites, antioxidants, ionhomeostasis, ABAbiosynthesis, and so on. To address this problem, various environment-friendly solutions such as salt-tolerant plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, eco-friendly additives, and foliar applications of osmoprotectants/antioxidants are urgently needed. CRISPR/Cas9, a new genetic scissor, has recently been discovered to be an efficient approach for reducing salt stress in plants growing in saline soil.

Facets of plant immunity counteract niche establishment by restricting water, nutrients and signals for virulence activation.

Various aspects of the role of ROS in plants have been discussed in previous reviews. In this review, we first summarize recent progress in the regulatory mechanisms of apoplastic ROS signaling and then propose its potential roles in plant defense against vascular pathogens to provide new ideas for the prevention and control of vascular diseases.",plant

The major abiotic factors such as drought, heat, cold, salinity, etc., hamper a plant's innate growth and development, resulting in reduced yield and quality, with the possibility of undesired traits. In the 21st century, the advent of high-throughput sequencing tools, state-of-the-art biotechnological techniques and bioinformatic analyzing pipelines led to the easy characterization of plant traits for abiotic stress response and tolerance mechanisms by applying the 'omics' toolbox. Panomics pipeline including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, proteogenomics, interactomics, ionomics, phenomics, etc., have become very handy nowadays. This is important to produce climate-smart future crops with a proper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of abiotic stress responses by the plant's genes, transcripts, proteins, epigenome, cellular metabolic circuits and resultant phenotype. Instead of mono-omics, two or more (hence 'multi-omics') integrated-omics approaches can decipher the plant's abiotic stress tolerance response very well. Multi-omics-characterized plants can be used as potent genetic resources to incorporate into the future breeding program. For the practical utility of crop improvement, multi-omics approaches for particular abiotic stress tolerance can be combined with genome-assisted breeding (GAB) by being pyramided with improved crop yield, food quality and associated agronomic traits and can open a new era of omics-assisted breeding. Thus, multi-omics pipelines together are able to decipher molecular processes, biomarkers, targets for genetic engineering, regulatory networks and precision agriculture solutions for a crop's variable abiotic stress tolerance to ensure food security under changing environmental circumstances.",plant

One major research challenge in plant biology and ecology is the interaction of photosynthesis with the environment. Stomata control plant gas exchange and their evolution was a crucial innovation that facilitated the earliest land plants to colonize terrestrial environments. Stomata couple homoiohydry, together with cuticles, intercellular gas space, with the endohydric water-conducting system, enabling plants to adapt and diversify across the planet. Plants control stomatal movement in response to environmental change through regulating guard cell turgor mediated by membrane transporters and signaling transduction. However, the origin, evolution, and active control of stomata remain controversial topics. We first review stomatal evolution and diversity, providing fossil and phylogenetic evidence of their origins. We summarize functional evolution of guard cell membrane transporters in the context of climate changes and environmental stresses. Our analyses show that the core signaling elements of stomatal movement are more ancient than stomata, while genes involved in stomatal development co-evolved de novo with the earliest stomata. These results suggest that novel stomatal development-specific genes were acquired during plant evolution, whereas genes regulating stomatal movement, especially cell signaling pathways, were inherited ancestrally and co-opted by dynamic functional differentiation. These two processes reflect the different adaptation strategies during land plant evolution.",plant

Intercellular and intracellular microbial symbionts that are asymptomatic in their plant host during some or all of their life cycle - endophytes - can form mutualistic, commensal, or pathogenic relationships, and sometimes novel associations with alien plants. Fungal endophytes are likely the most common endosymbiont infecting plants, with life-history, morphological, physiological, and plant-symbiotic traits that are distinct from other endophytic guilds. Here, we review the community dynamics of fungal endophytes during the process of plant invasion, and how their functional role may shift during the different stages of invasion: transport, introduction (colonisation), establishment, and spread. Each invasion stage presents distinct ecological filters that an alien plant must overcome to advance to the subsequent stage of invasion. Endophytes can alternately aid the host in overcoming stage-specific filters, or contribute to the barriers imposed by filters (e.g. biotic resistance), thereby affecting invasion pathways. A few fungi can be transported as seed endophytes from their native range and be vertically transmitted to future generations in the non-native range, especially in graminoids. In other plant groups, alien plants mostly acquire endophytes via horizontal transmission from the invaded plant community, and the host endophyte community is shaped by host filtering and biogeographic factors (e.g. dispersal limitation, environmental filtering). Endophytes infecting alien plants (both those transported with their host and those accumulated in the non-native range) may influence invasion success by affecting plant growth, reproduction, environmental tolerance, and pathogen and herbivory defences; however, the direction and magnitude of these effects can be contingent upon the host identity, life stage, ecological conditions, and invasion stage. This context dependence may cause endophytic fungi to shift to a non-endophytic (e.g. pathogenic) functional life stage in the same or different hosts, which can modify alien-native plant community dynamics. We conclude by identifying paths in which alien hosts can exploit the context dependency of endophyte function in novel abiotic and biotic conditions and at the different stages of invasion.",plant

Plants and microorganisms form complex interaction networks resulting in molecular signaling, nutrient exchange, and other distinct metabolic responses. In these networks, microbial partners influence growth and N use efficiency of plants either positively or negatively. Harnessing the beneficial effects of specific players within crop microbiomes is a promising strategy to counteract the emerging threats to human and planetary health due to the overuse of industrial N fertilizers.

Plants have evolved intricate relationships with a diverse array of microorganisms inhabiting their roots, leaves, and other plant tissues. This microbiota mainly includes bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoans, and viruses, forming a dynamic and interconnected network within and around the plant. Through mutualistic or cooperative interactions, these microbes contribute to various aspects of plant health and development. The direct mechanisms of the plant microbiome include the enhancement of plant growth and development through nutrient acquisition. Microbes have the ability to solubilize essential minerals, fix atmospheric nitrogen, and convert organic matter into accessible forms, thereby augmenting the nutrient pool available to the plant. Additionally, the microbiome helps plants to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses, such as pathogen attacks and adverse environmental conditions, by priming the plant's immune responses, antagonizing phytopathogens, and improving stress tolerance. Furthermore, the plant microbiome plays a vital role in phytohormone regulation, facilitating hormonal balance within the plant. This regulation influences various growth processes, including root development, flowering, and fruiting. Microbial communities can also produce secondary metabolites, which directly or indirectly promote plant growth, development, and health. Understanding the functional potential of the plant microbiome has led to innovative agricultural practices, such as microbiome-based biofertilizers and biopesticides, which harness the power of beneficial microorganisms to enhance crop yields while reducing the dependency on chemical inputs. In the present review, we discuss and highlight research gaps regarding the plant microbiome and how the plant microbiome can be used as a source of single and synthetic bioinoculants for plant growth and health.",plant

The traditional pathogen management methods relying on synthetic microbicides are often environment unfriendly. In contrast, PSMs provide promising alternative way due to their high efficiency and environmental benefits. This article reviews the categories, biosynthetic pathways, mechanisms of actions, and the commercialization of the PSMs to enhance our understanding of their pathogen resistance capabilities.

This chemo-diversity is mainly underpinned by a highly complex and biodiverse biochemical machinery. Plant metabolic enzymes originated and were inherited from their eukaryotic and prokaryotic ancestors and further diversified by the unprecedentedly high rates of gene duplication and functionalization experienced in land plants. Unlike prokaryotic microbes, which display frequent horizontal gene transfer events and multiple inputs of energy and organic carbon, land plants predominantly rely on organic carbon generated from CO2 and have experienced relatively few gene transfers during their recent evolutionary history. As such, plant metabolic networks have evolved in a stepwise manner using existing networks as a starting point and under various evolutionary constraints. That said, until recently, the evolution of only a handful of metabolic traits had been extensively investigated and as such, the evolution of metabolism has received a fraction of the attention of, the evolution of development, for example.

These growth-defence trade-offs have important implications for plant fitness and productivity and influence the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions. Biotic stress strongly affects plant cells' primary metabolism, including photosynthesis and respiration, the main source of energy and carbon skeletons for plant growth, development, and defence. Although the nature of photosynthetic limitations imposed by pathogens is variable, infection often increases photorespiratory pressure, generating conditions that promote ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate oxygenation, leading to a metabolic shift from assimilation to photorespiration. Photorespiration, the significant metabolic flux following photosynthesis, protects the photosynthetic apparatus from photoinhibition. However, recent studies reveal that its role is far beyond photoprotection. The intermediates of the photorespiratory cycle regulate photosynthesis, and photorespiration interacts with the metabolic pathways of nitrogen and sulphur, shaping the primary metabolism for stress responses. This work aims to present recent insights into the integration of photorespiration within the network of primary metabolism under biotic stress. It also explores the potential implications of regulating photosynthetic-photorespiratory metabolism for plant defence against bacterial and fungal pathogens.",plant

Noncoding RNAs can travel through not only plasmodesma and phloem but also intercellular barriers to regulate distinct processes. Increasing evidence shows that the intercellular trans-kingdom transmission of ncRNAs is able to modulate many important interactions between plants and other organisms, such as plant response to pathogen attack, the symbiosis between legume plants and rhizobia and the interactions with parasitic plants. In these interactions, plant ncRNAs are believed to be sorted into extracellular vesicles (EVs) or other nonvesicular vehicles to pass through cell barriers and trigger trans-kingdom RNA interference (RNAi) in recipient cells from different species. There is evidence that the features of extracellular RNAs and associated RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a role in defining the RNAs to retain in cell or secrete outside cells. Despite the few reports about RNA secretion pathway in plants, the export of extracellular ncRNAs is orchestrated by a series of pathways in plants.

It enhances osmolyte production, increases antioxidant enzyme activity, and improves photosynthesis, thereby improving cellular functions. Understanding the melatonin-mediated response and signalling can sustain crop production in heavy metal-stressed soils. Melatonin is a pleiotropic signal molecule that plays a critical role in plant growth and stress tolerance, particularly against heavy metals in soil. Heavy metals (HMs) are ubiquitously found in the soil-water environment and readily taken up by plants, thereby disrupting mineral nutrient homeostasis, osmotic balance, oxidative stress, and altered primary and secondary metabolism. Plants combat HM stress through inbuilt defensive mechanisms, such as metal exclusion, restricted foliar translocation, metal sequestration and compartmentalization, chelation, and scavenging of free radicals by antioxidant enzymes. Melatonin has a protective effect against the damaging effects of HM stress in plants. It achieves this by immobilizing HM in cell walls and sequestering them in root cell vacuoles, reducing HM's translocation from roots to shoots. This mechanism improves the uptake of macronutrients and micronutrients in plants. Additionally, melatonin enhances osmolyte production, improving the plant's water relations, and increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes to limit lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Melatonin also decreases chlorophyll degradation while increasing its synthesis, and enhances RuBisCO activity for better photosynthesis. All these functions contribute to improving the cellular functions of plants exposed to HM stress. This review aims to gain better insight into the melatonin-mediated response and signalling under HM stress in plants, which may be useful in sustaining crop production in heavy metal-stressed soils.",plant

Ammonium is oxidized to nitrate by nitrifiers, but roots can release biological nitrification inhibitors (BNIs). Under what conditions does root-exudation of BNIs facilitate nitrogen N uptake and reduce pollution by N loss to the environment? We modeled the spatial-temporal dynamics of nitrifiers, ammonium, nitrate, and BNIs around a root and simulated root N uptake and net rhizosphere N loss over the plant's life cycle. We determined the sensitivity of N uptake and loss to variations in the parameter values, testing a broad range of soil-plant-microbial conditions, including concentrations, diffusion, sorption, nitrification, population growth, and uptake kinetics. An increase in BNI exudation reduces net N loss and, under most conditions, increases plant N uptake. BNIs decrease uptake in the case of (1) low ammonium concentrations, (2) high ammonium adsorption to the soil, (3) rapid nitrate- or slow ammonium uptake by the plant, and (4) a slowly growing or (5) fast-declining nitrifier population. Bactericidal inhibitors facilitate uptake more than bacteriostatic ones. Some nitrification, however, is necessary to maximize uptake by both ammonium and nitrate transporter systems. An increase in BNI exudation should be co-selected with improved ammonium uptake. BNIs can reduce N uptake, which may explain why not all species exude BNIs but have a generally positive effect on the environment by increasing rhizosphere N retention.",plant

Although fungi and plants lack intermediate filaments, their dynamic structural network of actin filaments and microtubules regulates cell shape, division, polarity, and vesicular trafficking. However, the specialized functions of the cytoskeleton during plant-fungus interactions remain elusive. Recent reports demonstrate that the plant cytoskeleton responds to signal cues and pathogen invasion through remodeling, thereby coordinating immune receptor trafficking, membrane microdomain formation, aggregation of organelles, and transport of defense compounds. Emerging evidence also suggests that cytoskeleton remodeling further regulates host immunity by triggering salicylic acid signaling, reactive oxygen species generation, and pathogenesis-related gene expression. During host invasion, fungi undergo systematic cytoskeleton remodeling, which is crucial for successful host penetration and colonization. Furthermore, phytohormones act as an essential regulator of plant cytoskeleton dynamics and are frequently targeted by fungal effectors to disrupt the host's growth-defense balance. This review discusses recent advances in the understanding of cytoskeleton dynamics during plant-fungus interactions and provides novel insights into the relationship between phytohormones and cytoskeleton remodeling upon pathogen attack.

Nanoformulation of non-essential elements enhancing plant growth and stress tolerance also comes under the umbrella of NFs. NFs have an edge over conventional chemical fertilizers, viz., higher plant biomass and yield using much lesser fertilization, thereby reducing environmental pollution. Foliar and root applications of NFs lead to their successful uptake by the plant, depending on the size, surface charge, and other physicochemical properties of NFs. Smaller NFs can pass through channels on the waxy cuticle depending on the hydrophobicity, while larger NFs pass through the stomatal conduits of leaves. Charge-based adsorption, followed by apoplastic movement and endocytosis, translocates NFs through the root, while the size of NFs influences passage into vascular tissues. Recent transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies throw light on the molecular mechanisms of growth promotion by NFs. The expression levels of nutrient transporter genes are regulated by NFs, controlling uptake and minimizing excess nutrient toxicity. Accelerated growth by NFs is brought about by their extensive regulation of cell division, photosynthesis, carbohydrate, and nitrogen metabolism, as well as the phytohormone-dependent signaling pathways related to development, stress response, and plant defense. NFs mimic Ca,2+ eliciting second messengers and associated proteins in signaling cascades, reaching transcription factors and finally orchestrating gene expression to enhance growth and stress tolerance.

Mechanistically, effective amount of RALF is induced and released at the critical period of plant growth and development or under different external environmental factors. Recent studies also highlighted the role of RALF peptides as important regulators in plant intercellular communications, as well as their operation in signal perception and as ligands for different receptor kinases on the surface of the plasma membrane, to integrate various environmental cues. In this context, understanding the fine-print of above processes may be essential to solve the problems of crop adaptation to various harsh environments under current climate trends scenarios, by genetic means.

More than 25 Trichoderma species have been extensively studied and have demonstrated significant potential in inhibiting not only phytopathogen growth but also insect pest infestations. In addition to their use as biopesticides, there is increasing evidence that several Trichoderma species can function as fungal endophytes by colonizing the tissues of specific plants. This colonization enhances a plant's growth and improves its tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. In recent decades, there has been a proliferation of literature on the role of Trichoderma endophytes in crop protection. Although the mechanisms underlying plant-fungal endophyte interactions are not yet fully understood, several studies have suggested their potential application in agriculture, particularly in the mitigation of plant pests and diseases. This review focuses on the diversity of Trichoderma endophytic strains and their potential use in controlling specific diseases and pests of crop plants. Trichoderma endophytes are considered a potential solution to reduce production costs and environmental impact by decreasing reliance on agrochemicals.",plant

Using synthetic nematicides to control plant-parasitic nematodes has resulted in broad-spectrum toxicity to the environment. Plant-derived secondary metabolites have recently emerged as viable options that provide effective, greener, and renewable routes for managing plant-parasitic nematodes in various cropping systems. However, limited comprehensive information on plant-derived secondary metabolites sources, chemical structures, and nematicidal activities is available. This study aims to compile and analyze data on plant-based secondary metabolites with nematicidal properties collected over the last two decades. In this review, we identified 262 plant-based metabolites with nematicidal activities that were isolated from 35 plant families and 65 plant species. Alkaloids, terpenoids, saponins, flavonoids, coumarins, thiophenes, and annonaceous acetogenins were among the most studied compounds. In addition to the structure-activity relation for specific metabolites with nematicidal potency, various techniques for their extraction and isolation from plant material are discussed. Our findings demonstrate the potential of plants as a feedstock for sourcing nematicidal compounds and discovering new chemistries that could potentially be used for developing the next generation of nematicides. © 2024 The Author(s).

These MTs were instrumental in regulating ion balance and promoting the absorption and segregation of vital nutrients, thereby enhancing salt stress tolerance. Various plant hormones, including abscisic acid, auxin, ethylene, cytokinin, and gibberellins, along with gaseous growth regulators such as nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide, collaborate to regulate and synchronize numerous aspects of plant growth, development, and stress responses to environmental factors. These transporters and other phytohormones, including brassinosteroids, melatonin, and salicylic acid, also collaborated to initiate adaptation processes, such as controlling osmotic pressure, removing ions, and initiating stress signaling pathways.

The associated limit on aerobic respiration can be fatal. Therefore, plants have evolved sensing systems that monitor oxygen levels and trigger a suite of metabolic, physiologic, and developmental responses to endure, or potentially escape, these oxygen-limiting conditions. Low oxygen stress has long been known to trigger changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels in plants, and recent work has seen some major steps forward in characterizing these events as part of a Ca2+-based signaling system through (1) defining how hypoxia may trigger and then shape the dynamics of these Ca2+ signals, and (2) identifying a host of the downstream elements that allow Ca2+ to regulate a wide-ranging network of hypoxia responses. Calcium transporters such as the CAX family of Ca2+/H+ antiporters at the tonoplast have emerged as important components of the system that forms hypoxia-related Ca2+ signals. Downstream lies a web of Ca2+-responsive proteins such as the calmodulin like proteins, Ca2+-dependent kinases, and the calcineurin-B like proteins along with their interacting kinases. A host of other regulators such as reactive oxygen species and lipid-mediated signals then act in parallel to the Ca2+-dependent events to closely control and coordinate the myriad responses that characterize the plant's low oxygen response.",plant

This may adversely affect crop and other non-target plants because the plant's resilience and resistance largely rely on plant-associated microbes. Ubiquitous glyphosate residues in soil and how they impact mutualistic microbes inhabiting the aboveground plant parts are largely unexplored. We studied the effects of herbicide residues in soil on Epichloë sp., which are common endophytic symbionts inhabiting aerial parts of cool-season grasses. In this symbiosis, the obligate symbiont subsists entirely on its host plant, and in exchange, it provides alkaloids conferring resistance to herbivores for the host grass that invests little in its own chemical defence. We first show decreased growth of Epichloë endophytes in vitro when directly exposed to two concentrations of glyphosate or glyphosate-based herbicides. Second, we provide evidence for a reduction of Epichloë-derived, insect-toxic loline alkaloids in endophyte-symbiotic meadow fescue (F. pratensis) plants growing in soil with a glyphosate history. Plants were grown for 2 years in an open field site, and natural herbivore infestation was correlated with the glyphosate-mediated reduction of loline alkaloid concentrations. Our findings indicate that herbicides residing in soil not only affect rhizosphere microbiota but also aerial plant endophyte functionality, which emphasizes the destructive effects of glyphosate on plant symbiotic microbes, here with cascading effects on plant-pest insect interactions.",plant

Excess or deficient provision of metal/metalloids puts plant's life and survival at risk, thus considered a potent stress for plants. Chloroplasts as an organelle with a high metal demand form a pivotal site within the metal homeostasis network. Therefore, the metal-mediated electron transport chain (ETC) in chloroplasts is a primary target site of metal/metalloid-induced stresses. Both excess and deficient availability of metal/metalloids threatens plant's photosynthesis in several ways. Energy demands from the photosynthetic carbon reactions should be in balance with energy output of ETC. Malfunctioning of ETC components as a result of metal/metalloid stress initiates photoinhiition. A feedback inhibition from carbon fixation process also impedes the ETC. Metal stress impairs antioxidant enzyme activity, pigment biosynthesis, and stomatal function.

Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of metal/metalloid stress, as well as the exploration of potential strategies to mitigate its impact on plants are imperative. This review offers a mechanistic insight into the disruption of photosynthesis regulation by metal/metalloids and highlights adaptive approaches to ameliorate their effects on plants. Focus was made on photostasis, nutrient interactions, phytohormones, and genetic interventions for mitigating metal/metalloid stresses.",plant

Active restoration frequently involves revegetation, which leads to the dilemma of whether to conduct direct seeding or to plant nursery-grown seedlings. The choice of revegetation method can regulate plant survival and performance, with economic implications that ultimately feed back to our capacity to conduct restoration. We followed a peer-reviewed protocol to develop a systematic map that collates, describes and catalogues the available studies on how seeding compares to planting in achieving restoration targets. We compiled a database with the characteristics of all retrieved studies, which can be searched to identify studies of particular locations and habitats, objectives of restoration, plant material, technical aspects, and outcomes measured. The search was made in eight languages and retrieved 3355 publications, of which 178 were retained. The systematic map identifies research gaps, such as a lack of studies in the global South, in tropical rainforests, and covering a long time period, which represent opportunities to expand field-based research. Additionally, many studies overlooked reporting on important technical aspects such as seed provenance and nursery cultivation methods, and others such as watering or seedling protection were more frequently applied for planting than for seeding, which limits our capacity to learn from past research. Most studies measured outcomes related to the target plants but avoided measuring general restoration outcomes or economic aspects. This represents a relevant gap in research, as the choice of revegetation method is greatly based on economic aspects and the achievement of restoration goals goes beyond the establishment of plants. Finally, we identified a substantial volume of studies conducted in temperate regions and over short periods (0-5 y). This research cluster calls for a future in-depth synthesis, potentially through meta-analysis, to reveal the overall balance between seeding and planting and assess whether the response to this question is mediated by species traits, environmental characteristics, or technical aspects. Besides identifying research clusters and gaps, the systematic map database allows managers to find the most relevant scientific literature on the appropriateness of seeding vs. planting for particular conditions, such as certain species or habitats.",plant

This review accumulates substantial evidence that portrays ABA as a crucial regulatory hub, coordinating the complex network of plant antiviral immunity. It is capable of synchronizing resistance pathways, yet it can also be exploited as a susceptibility factor by viral effectors. ABA fortifies multi-layered defenses on one hand, by activating RNA silencing mechanisms that precisely degrade viral genomes, strengthening plasmodesmal gateways with callose barriers, and priming the transcriptional programs of resistance genes. On the other hand, ABA can augment susceptibility by counteracting other defense hormones, dampening oxidative bursts, and inhibiting antiviral defence proteins. Interestingly, a variety of viruses have independently evolved strategies to manipulate ABA signalling pathways. This fascinating paradigm of hormonal conflicts unveils ABA as an important regulatory handle that determines infection trajectories. Future studies should carefully explore the multifaceted impacts of ABA modulation on plant immunity and susceptibility to diverse pathogens before considering practical applications in viral resistance strategies.",plant

Although examples of green roofs constructed decades ago exist, rarely are green roofs monitored over such long periods, and in ways that allow for experimentation, analysis, and conclusions about performance or function. In this study we present findings on plant cover and biomass from a green roof testing facility in Toronto, Canada that was monitored for over a decade. We examine the contributions of growing media, planting, and irrigation in the first seven years (2011-2021) of the eleven-year monitoring period. We found that during this maintenance phase period (2011-2017), plant cover and biomass was highest in modules planted with Sedum, included organic media, and were irrigated, whereas non-irrigated modules planted with forbs and grasses had the poorest performance regardless of media type. Following the stoppage of irrigation, and the post maintenance phase (2017-2021), modules initially planted with Sedum continued to sustain cover and biomass whereas planted forbs and grasses mostly disappeared, and these treatments were overtaken by Sedum. Our findings demonstrate that with irrigation, plantings of forbs and grasses can sustain plant cover and biomass.

Plants have developed physiological, biochemical, and molecular ways of defense against Cr, such as by augmenting antioxidant potential to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS). A number of genes have been discovered to play a significant role in the defense mechanisms of plants against Cr, for example, genes associated with the activation of phytochelatins, metallothioneins, and those of enzymes like glutathione-S-transferases. Along with this, a few miRNAs have been found to be associated in alleviating Cr stress and, to augment plant tolerance by controlling transcription factors, HSPs, and the expression of a few proteins and hormones.

Salinity stress tolerance has been present in wild crop relatives but then lost, or significantly weakened, during their domestication. Given the genetic and physiological complexity of salinity tolerance traits, agronomical solutions may be a suitable alternative to crop breeding for improved salinity stress tolerance. One of them is optimizing fertilization practices to assist plants in dealing with elevated salt levels in the soil. In this review, we analyse the causal relationship between the availability of boron (an essential metalloid micronutrient) and plant's adaptive responses to salinity stress at the whole-plant, cellular, and molecular levels, and a possibility of using boron for salt stress mitigation. The topics covered include the impact of salinity and the role of boron in cell wall remodelling, plasma membrane integrity, hormonal signalling, and operation of various membrane transporters mediating plant ionic and water homeostasis. Of specific interest is the role of boron in the regulation of H+-ATPase activity whose operation is essential for the control of a broad range of voltage-gated ion channels. The complex relationship between boron availability and expression patterns and the operation of aquaporins is also discussed.",plant

Depending on the interaction between the plant and microbes, this interaction can either help or harm plant health. Microbes interact with plants by secreting proteins that influence plant cells, producing bioactive compounds like antibiotics or toxins, and releasing molecules such as N-acyl homoserine lactones to coordinate their behaviour. They also produce phytohormones which help regulate growth and stress responses in plants. Plants also interact with the associated microorganisms by exuding substances such as carbon and nitrogen sources, quorum-sensing molecules, peptide signals, secondary metabolites such as flavonoids and strigolactones. A successful exchange of chemical signals is essential for maintaining these associations, with significant implications for plant growth and development. This review explores the intricate array of signaling molecules and complex mechanisms governing plant-microbe interactions, elucidating the pivotal role of chemo-communication pathways.

Recent research has shown that the rhizosphere environment is far more dynamic than previously recognised, with evidence emerging for diurnal rhythmicity in rhizosphere chemistry and microbial community composition. This rhythmicity is in part linked to the host plant's circadian rhythm, although some heterotrophic rhizosphere bacteria and fungi may also possess intrinsic rhythmicity. We review the evidence for diurnal rhythmicity in rhizosphere microbial communities and its link to the plant circadian clock. Factors which may drive microbial rhythmicity are discussed, including diurnal change in root exudate flux and composition, rhizosphere physico-chemical properties and plant immunity. Microbial processes which could contribute to community rhythmicity are considered, including self-sustained microbial rhythms, bacterial movement into and out of the rhizosphere, and microbe-microbe interactions. We also consider evidence that changes in microbial composition mediated by the plant circadian clock may affect microbial function and its significance for plant health and broader soil biogeochemical cycling processes. We identify key knowledge gaps and approaches which could help to resolve the spatial and temporal variation and functional significance of rhizosphere microbial rhythmicity. This includes unravelling the factors which determine the oscillation of microbial activity, growth and death, and cross-talk with the host over diurnal time frames. We conclude that diurnal rhythmicity is an inherent characteristic of the rhizosphere and that temporal factors should be considered and reported in rhizosphere studies.",plant

This might be an efficient and low-cost strategy and a substantial extension to the rhizomicrobiome recruitment theory. We found that the plant regulated the sequential expression of genes related to biocontrol and plant growth promotion in two well-studied rhizobacteria Bacillus velezensis SQR9 and Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 through root exudate succession across the plant developmental stages. Sixteen key chemicals in root exudates were identified to significantly regulate the rhizobacterial functional gene expression by high-throughput qPCR.

A coordinated regulation of plant responses to combined abiotic/biotic stresses requires crosstalk between signaling pathways initiated by each stressor. Interconnected signaling pathways further finetune plant stress responses and allow the plant to respond to such stresses effectively. The plant nutritional status might influence disease resistance by strengthening or weakening plant immune responses, as well as through modulation of the pathogenicity program in the pathogen. Here, we discuss advances in our understanding of interactions between nutrient stress, deficiency or excess, and immune signaling pathways in the context of current agricultural practices. The introduction of chemical fertilizers and pesticides was a major component of the Green Revolution initiated in the 1960s that greatly boosted crop production. However, the massive application of agrochemicals also has adverse consequences on the environment and animal/human health. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the connections between stress caused by overfertilization (or low bioavailability of nutrients) and immune responses is a timely and novel field of research with important implications for disease control in crop species.

Understanding how plants navigate DS is paramount to mitigating its adverse effects. In response to DS, plants synthesize or accumulate various plant growth regulators (PGRs), including phytohormones, neurotransmitters, gasotransmitters, and polyamines, which present promising sustainable green chemical strategies to adapt or tolerate stress conditions. These PGRs orchestrate crucial plant structure and function adjustments, activating defense systems and modulating cellular-level responses, transcript levels, transcription factors, metabolic genes, and stress-responsive candidate proteins.

Also, the disintegration of grana staking, and an increase in the size of mitochondria were observed under salinity and drought conditions. Drought and salt stresses can significantly decrease plant height, number of leaves and branches, leaf area, fresh and dry weight, or plant relative water content (RWC%) and concentration of photosynthetic pigments. On the other hand, stress-induced lipid peroxidation and malondialdehyde (MDA) production, electrolyte leakage (EL%), and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can increase under salinity and drought conditions.

It sets optimum posture and develops plant architecture to efficiently use resources like water, nutrients, CO2, and gaseous exchange. Hence, gravitropism is crucial for crop productivity as well as for the growth of plants in challenging climate. Some SGR members are known to affect tiller and shoot angle, organ size, and inflorescence stem in plants. Although the SHOOT GRAVITROPISM (SGR) family plays a key role in regulating the fate of shoot gravitropism, little is known about its function compared to other proteins involved in gravity response in plant cells and tissues. Moreover, less information on the SGR family's physiological activities and biochemical responses in shoot gravitropism is available. This review scrutinizes and highlights the recent developments in shoot gravitropism and provides an outlook for future crop development, multi-application scenarios, and translational research to improve agricultural productivity. Plants have evolved multiple gene families specialized in gravitropic responses, of which the SGR family is highly significant.

It represents a habitat where there is contact between seed-associated microbes and soil microbes, but it is studied less than other plant habitats. Previous studies on spermosphere microbiology were primarily culture based or did not sample the spermosphere soil as initially defined in space and time. Thus, the objectives of this study were to develop an efficient strategy to collect spermosphere soils around imbibing soybean and cotton in nonsterile soil and investigate changes in microbial communities. The method employed sufficiently collected spermosphere soil as initially defined in space by constraining the soil sampled with a cork borer and confining the soil to a 12-well microtiter plate. Spermosphere prokaryote composition changed over time and depended on the crop within 6 h after seeds were sown. By 12 to 18 h, crops had unique microbial communities in spermosphere soils. Prokaryote evenness dropped following seed imbibition, with the proliferation of copiotrophic soil bacteria. Due to their long history of plant growth promotion, prokaryote operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Burkholderia, Massilia, Azospirillum, and Pseudomonas were notable organisms enriched. Fungi and prokaryotes were hub taxa in cotton and soybean spermosphere networks. Additionally, the enriched taxa were not hubs in networks, suggesting that other taxa besides those enriched may be important for spermosphere communities. Overall, this study advances knowledge in the assembly of the plant microbiome early in a plant's life, which may have plant health implications in more mature plant growth stages. IMPORTANCE The central hypothesis of this research was that plant species and seed exudate release would alter the assembly of microbes in the spermosphere soil. Our research investigated the response of microbes to the initial burst of nutrients into the spermosphere soil, filling knowledge gaps from previous studies that pregerminated seeds under sterile conditions. We identified several copiotrophic bacterial lineages with a long history of plant growth promotion proliferating in response to the initial exudate release. With a comparative network approach, we show that these copiotrophic bacteria are not central to networks, demonstrating that other microbes (including fungi) may be important for community structure. This study improves knowledge on microbial dynamics in the understudied spermosphere and helps inform solutions for biologically or ecologically motivated solutions to spermosphere pathogens.",plant

However, models of plant strategies vary widely and have tended to emphasize either functional traits or life-history traits at the expense of integrating both into a general framework to improve our ecological and evolutionary understanding of plant form and function. Advancing our understanding of plant strategies will require investment in two complementary research agendas that together will unify functional ecology and population ecology. First, we must determine what is phenotypically possible by quantifying the dimensionality of plant traits. This step requires dense taxonomic sampling of traits on species representing the broad diversity of phylogenetic clades, environmental gradients, and geographical regions found across Earth. It is important that we continue to sample traits locally and share data globally to fill biased gaps in trait databases. Second, we must test the power of traits for explaining species distributions, demographic rates, and population growth rates across gradients of resource limitation, disturbance regimes, temperature, vegetation density, and frequencies of other strategies. This step requires thoughtful, theory-driven empiricism. Reciprocal transplant experiments beyond the native range and synthetic demographic modelling are the most powerful methods to determine how trait-by-environment interactions influence fitness. Moving beyond easy-to-measure traits and evaluating the traits that are under the strongest ecological selection within different environmental contexts will improve our understanding of plant adaptations. Plant strategy theory is poised to (i) unpack the multiple dimensions of productivity and disturbance gradients and differentiate adaptations to climate and resource limitation from adaptations to disturbance, (ii) distinguish between the fundamental and realized niches of phenotypes, and (iii) articulate the distinctions and relationships between functional traits and life-history traits.",plant

Ascorbate oxidase (AO) is a blue copper oxidase that is responsible for the oxidation of AsA with the concomitant production of water. For many decades, AO was erroneously postulated as an enzyme without any obvious advantage, as it decreases the AsA pool size and thus is expected to weaken plant stress resistance. It was only a decade ago that this perspective shifted towards the fundamental role of AO in orchestrating both AsA and oxygen levels by influencing the overall redox balance in the extracellular matrix. Consistent with its localization in the apoplast, AO is involved in cell expansion, division, resource allocation, and overall plant yield. An increasing number of transgenic studies has demonstrated that AO can also facilitate communication between the surrounding environment and the cell, as its gene expression is highly responsive to factors such as hormonal signaling, oxidative stress, and mechanical injury. This review aims to describe the multiple functions of AO in plant growth, development, and stress resilience, and explore any additional roles the enzyme might have in fruits during the course of ripening.",plant

It encompasses the objectives of preserving the environment, fostering economic growth, and promoting socioeconomic equality. To achieve sustainable development for humanity, it is imperative to prioritize sustainable agriculture. One significant approach to achieving this transition is the extensive utilization of microbes, which play a crucial role due to the genetic reliance of plants on the beneficial functions provided by symbiotic microbes. This review focuses on the significance of rhizospheric microbial communities, also known as the rhizomicrobiome (RM). It is a complex community of microorganisms that live in the rhizosphere and influence the plant's growth and health. It provides its host plant with various benefits related to plant growth, including biocontrol, biofertilization, phytostimulation, rhizoremediation, stress resistance, and other advantageous properties. Yet, the mechanisms by which the RM contributes to sustainable agriculture remain largely unknown. Investigating this microbial population presents a significant opportunity to advance toward sustainable agriculture. Hence, this study aims to provide an overview of the diversity and applications of RM in sustainable agriculture practices. Lately, there has been growing momentum in various areas related to rhizobiome research and its application in agriculture. This includes rhizosphere engineering, synthetic microbiome application, agent-based modeling of the rhizobiome, and metagenomic studies.

Among the crucial orchestrators of these responses is the CBL-CIPK pathway, comprising calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) and CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). While CIPKs act as serine/threonine protein kinases, transmitting calcium signals, CBLs function as calcium sensors, influencing the plant's response to abiotic stress. This review explores the intricate interactions between the CBL-CIPK pathway and plant hormones such as ABA, auxin, ethylene, and jasmonic acid (JA). It highlights their role in fine-tuning stress responses for optimal survival and acclimatization. Building on previous studies that demonstrated the enhanced stress tolerance achieved by upregulating CBL and CIPK genes, we explore the regulatory mechanisms involving post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. Despite significant contributions from prior research, gaps persist in understanding the nuanced interplay between the CBL-CIPK system and plant hormone signaling under diverse abiotic stress conditions. In contrast to broader perspectives, our review focuses on the interaction of the pathway with crucial plant hormones and its implications for genetic engineering interventions to enhance crop stress resilience. This specialized perspective aims to contribute novel insights to advance our understanding of the potential of the CBL-CIPK pathway to mitigate crops' abiotic stress.",plant

Plants in the natural environment usually encounter warmer temperatures during the day and cooler temperatures at night, suggesting both light and temperature are closely linked signals.

This review outlines the diverse mechanisms of light and temperature perception, and downstream signalling, with an emphasis on their integration and interconnection. Recent research has highlighted the regulation of thermomorphogenesis by photoreceptors and their downstream light signalling proteins under different light conditions, and circadian clock components at warm temperatures. Here, we comprehensively describe these studies and demonstrate their connection with plant developmental responses. We also explain how the gene signalling pathways of photomorphogenesis and thermomorphogenesis are interconnected with the heat stress response to mediate thermotolerance, revealing new avenues to manipulate plants for climate resilience. In addition, the role of sugars as signalling molecules between light and temperature signalling pathways is also highlighted.

Commonality in the genetic hardware of plants has enabled robust comparative genomics that has provided a broad picture of angiosperm evolution and implicated both general processes and specific elements in contributing to botanical diversity. We argue that the hardware of plant genomes-both in content and in dynamics-has been shaped by selection for rather substantial differences in gene regulation between plants and animals such as maize and human, organisms of comparable genome size and gene number. Their distinctive genome content and dynamics may reflect in part the indeterminate development of plants that puts strikingly different demands on gene regulation than in animals. Repeated polyploidization of plant genomes and multiplication of individual genes together with extensive rearrangement and differential retention provide rich raw material for selection of morphological and/or physiological variations conferring fitness in specific niches, whether natural or artificial.

For several decades, botanical research has complemented and, in some cases, challenged concepts on speciation developed via the study of other organisms while also revealing additional ways in which species can form. Now, the ability to sequence genomes at an unprecedented pace and scale has allowed biologists to settle decades-long debates and tackle other emerging challenges in speciation research. Here, we review these recent genome-enabled developments in plant speciation. We discuss complications related to identification of reproductive isolation (RI) loci using analyses of the landscape of genomic divergence and highlight the important role that structural variants have in speciation, as increasingly revealed by new sequencing technologies. Further, we review how genomics has advanced what we know of some routes to new species formation, like hybridization or whole-genome duplication, while casting doubt on others, like population bottlenecks and genetic drift. While genomics can fast-track identification of genes and mutations that confer RI, we emphasize that follow-up molecular and field experiments remain critical. Nonetheless, genomics has clarified the outsized role of ancient variants rather than new mutations, particularly early during speciation. We conclude by highlighting promising avenues of future study. These include expanding what we know so far about the role of epigenetic and structural changes during speciation, broadening the scope and taxonomic breadth of plant speciation genomics studies, and synthesizing information from extensive genomic data that have already been generated by the plant speciation community.",genome

MAIN: The environment influences an organism's genome through ambient factors in the biosphere (e.g. climate and UV radiation), as well as the agents it comes into contact with, i.e. the epigenetic and mutagenic effects of inanimate chemicals and pollution, and pathogenic organisms. Emerging scientific consensus is that social determinants of health, environmental conditions and genetic factors work together to influence the risk of many complex illnesses. That paradigm can also explain the environmental and ecological determinants of health as factors that underlie the (un)healthy ecosystems on which communities rely. We suggest that The Ecological Genome Project is an aspirational opportunity to explore connections between the human genome and nature. We propose consolidating a view of Ecogenomics to provide a blueprint to respond to the environmental challenges that societies face. This can only be achieved by interdisciplinary engagement between genomics and the broad field of ecology and related practice of conservation. In this respect, the One Health approach is a model for environmental orientated work. The idea of Ecogenomics-a term that has been used to relate to a scientific field of ecological genomics-becomes the conceptual study of genomes within the social and natural environment. The HUGO Committee on Ethics, Law and Society (CELS) recommends that an interdisciplinary One Health approach should be adopted in genomic sciences to promote ethical environmentalism. This perspective has been reviewed and endorsed by the HUGO CELS and the HUGO Executive Board.",genome

In contrast to the evolutionary processes that occurred at the origin of vertebrates or prior to the radiation of teleost fishes, no whole-genome duplication events occurred during the water-to-land transition, and it remains an open question how did genome dynamics contribute to this prominent evolutionary event. Indeed, the recent sequencing of sarcopterygian and amphibian genomes has revealed that the extant lineages immediately preceding and succeeding this transition harbor an exceptional number of transposable elements and it is tempting to speculate that these sequences might have catalyzed the adaptations that enabled vertebrates to venture into land. Here, we review the genome dynamics associated with the major transitions in vertebrate evolution and discuss how the highly repetitive genomic landscapes revealed by recent efforts to characterize the genomes of amphibians and sarcopterygians argue for turbulent genome dynamics occurring before the water-to-land transition and possibly enabling it.",genome

Specifically, we improve scalability and user-friendliness, and we provide many new statistics tailored to variation graphs for graph evaluation, including sample-specific features. We developed an efficient, comprehensive, and integrated tool, gretl, to analyze genome graphs and gain insights into their structure and composition by providing a wide range of statistics. gretl can be utilized to evaluate different graphs, compare the output of graph construction pipelines with different parameters, as well as perform an in-depth analysis of individual graphs, including sample-specific analysis. With the assistance of gretl, novel patterns of genetic variation and potential regions of interest can be identified, for later, more detailed inspection. We demonstrate that gretl outperforms other tools in terms of speed, particularly for larger genome graphs.

The user can rapidly move between scales that depict the entire genome, individual genes, and the sequence; Genome Explorer presents the most relevant detail and context for each scale. By downloading the data for the entire genome to the user's web browser and dynamically generating visualizations locally, we enable ﬁne control of zoom and pan functions and real-time redrawing of the visualization, resulting in smoother and more intuitive exploration of a genome than is possible with other browsers. Further, genome features are presented together, in-line, using familiar graphical depictions.

While microarray and whole-exome sequencing based studies have been the primary methods for establishing new CP-gene relationships and providing a genetic etiology for individual patients, the cause of their condition remains unknown for many patients with CP. Recent advancements in genomic technologies offer additional opportunities to uncover variations in human genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenomes that have previously escaped detection. In this review, we outline the use of these state-of-the-art technologies to address the molecular diagnostic challenges experienced by individuals with CP. We also explore the importance of identifying a molecular etiology whenever possible, given the potential for genomic medicine to provide opportunities to treat patients with CP in new and more precise ways.",genome

This exclusion is problematic, as it leads to disparities in the understanding of the genetic structure and history of diverse cohorts and the performance of genomic medicine across populations. Admixed populations have particular statistical challenges, as they inherit genomic segments from multiple source populations-the primary reason they have historically been excluded from genetic studies. In recent years, however, an increasing number of statistical methods and software tools have been developed to account for and leverage admixture in the context of genomics analyses. Here, we provide a survey of such computational strategies for the informed consideration of admixture to allow for the well-calibrated inclusion of mixed ancestry populations in large-scale genomics studies, and we detail persisting gaps in existing tools.",genome

Currently, Kutzneria chonburiensis SMC256T has been the latest type-strain of the genus and its genome sequence has not been reported yet. Therefore, we present the first report of new complete genome sequence of SMC256T (genome size of 10.4 Mbp) with genome annotation and feature comparison between SMC256T and other publicly available Kutzneria species. The results from comparative and functional genomic analyses regarding the phylogenomic and the clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COGs) analyses indicated that SMC256T is most closely related to Kutzneria sp. 744, Kutzneria kofuensis, Kutzneria sp.

Out of which, 38 clusters showing the best hit to the most known BGCs were predicted in the SMC256Tgenome. We observed that six clusters responsible for biosynthesis of antimicrobials/antitumor metabolites were strain-specific in Kutzneria chonburiensis. These putative metabolites include virginiamycin S1, lysolipin I, esmeraldin, rakicidin, aclacinomycin and streptoseomycin. Based on these findings, the genome of Kutzneria chonburiensis contains distinct and unidentified BGCs different from other members of the genus, and the use of integrative genomic-based approach would be a useful alternative effort to target, isolate and identify putative and undiscovered secondary metabolites suspected to have new and/or specific bioactivity in the Kutzneria.",genome

As genome assembly methods continue to advance and production costs become a less significant obstacle, genome assemblies for multiple inbred rat strains are emerging. These assemblies will allow a rat pangenome assembly to be constructed that captures all the genetic variations in strains selected for their utility in research and will overcome reference bias, a limitation associated with reliance on a single reference assembly.

The diversity of available taxa now allows finer-scale comparisons between mt and nuclear phylogenomic analyses; high levels of congruence have been found for most orders, with some significant exceptions (e.g., Odonata, Mantodea, Diptera). The evolution of mt gene rearrangements and their association with haplodiploidy have been tested with expanded taxonomic sampling, and earlier proposed trends have been largely supported. Multiple model systems have been developed based on findings unique to insects, including mt genome fragmentation (lice and relatives) and control region duplication (thrips), allowing testing of hypothesized evolutionary drivers of these aberrant genomic phenomena.

Our knowledge of this phenomenon among free-living bacteria remains scarce. We address the dynamics and limits of genome reduction by examining one of the most abundant bacteria in the ocean, the SAR86 clade. Despite its abundance, comparative genomics has been limited by the absence of pure cultures and the poor representation in metagenome-assembled genomes. We co-assembled multiple previously available single-amplified genomes to obtain the first complete genomes from members of the four families. All families showed a convergent evolutionary trajectory with characteristic features of streamlined genomes, most pronounced in the TMED112 family. This family has a genome size of ca. 1 Mb and only 1 bp as median intergenic distance, exceeding values found in other abundant microbes such as SAR11, OM43 and Prochlorococcus. This genomic simplification led to a reduction in the biosynthesis of essential molecules, DNA repair-related genes, and the ability to sense and respond to environmental factors, which could suggest an evolutionary dependence on other co-occurring microbes for survival (Black Queen hypothesis). Therefore, these reconstructed genomes within the SAR86 clade provide new insights into the limits of genome reduction in free-living marine bacteria.",genome

Robust comparative analysis is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of genotypic variations of phages and their related evolutionary processes, and to investigate the interaction mechanisms between phages and their hosts. In this chapter, we present a protocol for phage comparative genomics employing tools selected out of the many currently available, focusing on complete genomes of phages classified in the class Caudoviricetes. This protocol provides accurate identification of similarities, differences, and patterns among new and previously known complete phage genomes as well as phage clustering and taxonomic classification.",genome

In addition, the functionality of these tools becomes computationally prohibitive due to the significant compute resources needed to handle larger genomes. In this research, we present CoreDetector, an easy-to-use general-purpose program that can align the core-genome sequences for a range of genome sizes and divergence levels. To illustrate the flexibility of CoreDetector, we conducted alignments of a large set of closely related fungal pathogen and hexaploid wheat cultivar genomes as well as more divergent fly and rodent species genomes. In all cases, compared to existing multiple genome alignment tools, CoreDetector exhibited improved flexibility, efficiency, and competitive accuracy in tested cases. CoreDetector was developed in the cross platform, and easily deployable, Java language.

Here, we present the WashU Comparative Epigenome Browser. It allows users to load functional genomic data sets/annotations mapped to different genomes and display them over syntenic regions simultaneously. The browser also displays genetic differences between the genomes from single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) to structural variants (SVs) to visualize the association between epigenomic differences and genetic differences. Instead of anchoring all data sets to the reference genome coordinates, it creates independent coordinates of different genome assemblies to faithfully present features and data mapped to different genomes. It uses a simple, intuitive genome-align track to illustrate the syntenic relationship between different species. It extends the widely used WashU Epigenome Browser infrastructure and can be expanded to support multiple species.

Inconsistent naming hinders the identification of correct assemblies, complicates the integration of bioinformatics pipelines, and makes it difficult to link assemblies across multiple resources. To address this, we developed a specification for standardizing the naming of reference genome assemblies, to improve consistency across datasets and facilitate interoperability. This specification was created with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) practices in mind, ensuring that reference assemblies are easier to locate, access, and reuse across research communities. Additionally, it has been designed to comply with primary genomic data repositories, including members of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration consortium, ensuring compatibility with widely used databases. While initially tailored to the agricultural genomics community, the specification is adaptable for use across different taxa. Widespread adoption of this standardized nomenclature would streamline assembly management, better enable cross-species analyses, and improve the reproducibility of research. It would also enhance natural language processing applications that depend on consistent reference assembly names in genomic literature, promoting greater integration and automated analysis of genomic data.

A primary result of this work is a curated fungal database containing 5,667 unique genomes representing 245 species. TheiaEuk also incorporates taxon-specific submodules for specific species, including clade-typing for Candida auris (C. auris). In addition, for several fungal species, it performs dynamic reference genome selection and variant calling, reporting mutations found in genes currently associated with antifungal resistance (FKS1, ERG11, FUR1). Using genome assemblies from the ATCC Mycology collection, the taxonomic identification module used by TheiaEuk correctly assigned genomes to the species level in 126/135 (93.3%) instances and to the genus level in 131/135 (97%) of instances, and provided zero false calls. Application of TheiaEuk to actual specimens obtained in the course of work at a local public health laboratory resulted in 13/15 (86.7%) correct calls at the species level, with 2/15 called at the genus level. It made zero incorrect calls. TheiaEuk accurately assessed clade type of Candida auris in 297/302 (98.3%) of instances. TheiaEuk demonstrated effectiveness in identifying fungal species from whole genome sequence. It further showed accuracy in both clade-typing of C. auris and in the identification of mutations known to associate with drug resistance in that organism.",genome

We propose that divergence time among lineages is a key factor driving this variability: as lineages diverge, the extent of gene reuse should decrease due to reductions in allele sharing, functional differentiation among genes, and restructuring of genome architecture. Indeed, we show that many genomic studies of repeated adaptation find that more recently diverged lineages exhibit higher gene reuse during repeated adaptation, but the relationship becomes less clear at older divergence time scales. Thus, future research should explore the factors shaping gene reuse and their interplay across broad divergence time scales for a deeper understanding of evolutionary repeatability.",genome

Homoeologous chromosomes (chromosomes with common shared ancestry) may undergo recombination immediately after allopolyploid formation and continue over successive generations. The outcome of this meiotic pairing behavior is dynamic and complex. Homoeologous exchanges (HEs) may lead to the formation of unbalanced gametes, reduced fertility, and selective disadvantage. By contrast, HEs could act as sources of novel evolutionary substrates, shifting the relative dosage of parental gene copies, generating novel phenotypic diversity, and helping the establishment of neo-allopolyploids. However, HE patterns vary among lineages, across generations, and even within individual genomes and chromosomes. The causes and consequences of this variation are not fully understood, though interest in this evolutionary phenomenon has increased in the last decade. Recent technological advances show promise in uncovering the mechanistic basis of HEs. Here, we describe recent observations of the common patterns among allopolyploid angiosperm lineages, underlying genomic and epigenomic features, and consequences of HEs. We identify critical research gaps and discuss future directions with far-reaching implications in understanding allopolyploid evolution and applying them to the development of important phenotypic traits of polyploid crops.",genome

Genome research on dinoflagellates has lagged due to their immense genome sizes in most species (~ 1-250 Gbp). Nevertheless, the last decade marked a fruitful era of dinoflagellate genomics, with 27 genomes sequenced and many insights attained. This review aims to synthesize information from these genomes, along with other omic data, to reflect on where we are now in understanding dinoflagellates and where we are heading in the future. The most notable insights from the decade-long genomics work include: (1) dinoflagellate genomes have been expanded in multiple times independently, probably by a combination of rampant retroposition, accumulation of repetitive DNA, and genome duplication; (2) Symbiodiniacean genomes are highly divergent, but share about 3,445 core unigenes concentrated in 219 KEGG pathways; (3) Most dinoflagellate genes are encoded unidirectionally and are not intron-poor; (4) The dinoflagellate nucleus has undergone extreme evolutionary changes, including complete or nearly complete loss of nucleosome and histone H1, and acquisition of dinoflagellate viral nuclear protein (DVNP); (5) Major basic nuclear protein (MBNP), histone-like protein (HLP), and bacterial HU-like protein (HCc) belong to the same protein family, and MBNP can be the unifying name; (6) Dinoflagellate gene expression is regulated by poorly understood mechanisms, but microRNA and other epigenetic mechanisms are likely important; (7) Over 50% of dinoflagellate genes are ""dark"" and their functions remain to be deciphered using functional genetics; (8) Initial insights into the genomic basis of parasitism and mutualism have emerged.

As an important genetic resource, C. mollissima is vital in enhancing edible chestnut varieties and offers significant insights into the origin and evolution of chestnut species. While the chloroplast genome of C. mollissima has been sequenced, its mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) remains largely uncharted. In this study, we have characterized the C. mollissima mitogenome, assembling it utilizing reads from both BGI and Nanopore sequencing platforms, and conducted a comparative analysis with the mitochondrial genomes of closely related species. The mitogenome of C. mollissima manifests a polycyclic structure consisting of two circular molecules measuring 363,232 bp and 24,806 bp, respectively. This genome encompasses 35 unique protein-coding genes, 19 tRNA genes, and three rRNA genes. A total of 139 SSRs were identified throughout the entire C. mollissima mitogenome. Furthermore, the combined length of homologous fragments between the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes was 5766 bp, constituting 1.49% of the mitogenome. We also predicted 484 RNA editing sites in C. mollissima, demonstrating C-to-U RNA editing. Phylogenetic analysis of related species' mitogenomes showed that C. mollissima was closely related to Lithocarpus litseifolius (Hance) Chun and Quercus acutissima Carruth. Interestingly, the mitogenome sequences of C. mollissima, L. litseifolius, Q. acutissima, Fagus sylvatica L., and Juglans mandshurica Maxim did not show conservation in their alignments, indicating frequent genome reorganization.

Numerous tools exist to annotate genes, gene clusters, mobile genetic elements, and other diverse features. However, these tools and pipelines can be difficult to install and run, be specialized for a particular element or feature, or lack annotations for larger elements that provide important genomic context. Integrating results across analyses is also important for understanding gene function. To address these challenges, we present the Beav annotation pipeline. Beav is a command-line tool that automates the annotation of bacterial genome sequences, mobile genetic elements, molecular systems and gene clusters, key regulatory features, and other elements. Beav uses existing tools in addition to custom models, scripts, and databases to annotate diverse elements, systems, and sequence features. Custom databases for plant-associated microbes are incorporated to improve annotation of key virulence and symbiosis genes in agriculturally important pathogens and mutualists. Beav includes an optional Agrobacterium-specific pipeline that identifies and classifies oncogenic plasmids and annotates plasmid-specific features. Following the completion of all analyses, annotations are consolidated to produce a single comprehensive output. Finally, Beav generates publication-quality genome and plasmid maps. Beav is on Bioconda and is available for download at https://github.com/weisberglab/beav. Annotation of genome features, such as the presence of genes and their predicted function, or larger loci encoding secretion systems or biosynthetic gene clusters, is necessary for understanding the functions encoded by an organism. Genomes can also host diverse mobile genetic elements, such as integrative and conjugative elements and/or phages, that are often not annotated by existing pipelines. These elements can horizontally mobilize genes encoding for virulence, antimicrobial resistance, or other adaptive functions and alter the phenotype of an organism. We developed a software pipeline, called Beav, that combines new and existing tools for the comprehensive annotation of these and other major features. Existing pipelines often misannotate loci important for virulence or mutualism in plant-associated bacteria. Beav includes custom databases and optional workflows for the improved annotation of plant-associated bacteria.

Bradypodion are known for their habitat specialization, with evidence of convergent phenotypes across the phylogeny. However, the underlying genetic architecture of these phenotypes remains unknown for Bradypodion, and without adequate genomic resources, many evolutionary questions cannot be answered. We present de novo assembled whole genomes for Bradypodion pumilum and Bradypodion ventrale, using Pacific Biosciences long-read sequencing data. BUSCO analysis revealed that 96.36% of single copy orthologs were present in the B. pumilum genome and 94% in B. ventrale. Moreover, these genomes boast scaffold N50 of 389.6 and 374.9 Mb, respectively. Based on a whole genome alignment of both Bradypodion genomes, B. pumilum is highly syntenic with B. ventrale. Furthermore, Bradypodion is also syntenic with Anolis lizards, despite the divergence between these lineages estimated to be nearly 170 Ma. Coalescent analysis of the genomic data also suggests that historical changes in effective population size for these species correspond to notable shifts in the southern African environment.

Yet, we usually need a suitable reference genome for mapping population-level resequencing data. In some model systems, multiple reference genomes are available, giving the challenging task of determining which reference genome best suits the data. Here, we compared the use of two different reference genomes for the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), one novel genome derived from a European gynogenetic individual and the published reference genome of a North American individual. Specifically, we investigated the impact of using a local reference versus one generated from a distinct lineage on several common population genomics analyses. Through mapping genome resequencing data of 60 sticklebacks from across Europe and North America, we demonstrate that genetic distance among samples and the reference genomes impacts downstream analyses. Using a local reference genome increased mapping efficiency and genotyping accuracy, effectively retaining more and better data. Despite comparable distributions of the metrics generated across the genome using SNP data (i.e. π, Tajima's D and FST ), window-based statistics using different references resulted in different outlier genes and enriched gene functions. A marker-based analysis of DNA methylation distributions had a comparably high overlap in outlier genes and functions, yet with distinct differences depending on the reference genome.

However, their higher cost often poses a significant barrier. To address this, we explore the utilization of mapping-based genome assembly and reference-guided assembly as cost-effective alternative approaches. We assess the efficacy of these approaches in improving the contiguity of Clarias batrachus and Culter alburnus draft genomes. Our findings demonstrate that employing an iterative mapping strategy leads to a reduction in assembly errors. Specifically, after three iterations, the Mismatches per 100 kbp value for the C. batrachus genome decreased from 2447.20 to 2432.67, reaching a minimum of 2422.67 after two iterations. Additionally, the N50 value for the C. batrachus genome increased from 362,143 to 1,315,126 bp, with a maximum of 1,315,403 bp after two iterations. Furthermore, we achieved Mismatches per 100 kbp values of 3.70 for the reference-guided assembly of C. batrachus and 0.34 for C. alburnus. Correspondingly, the N50 value for the C. batrachus and C. alburnus genomes increased from 362,143 bp and 3,686,385 bp to 2,026,888 bp and 43,735,735 bp, respectively. Finally, we successfully utilized the improved C. batrachus and C. alburnus genomes to compare genome studies using the combined approach of Ragout and Ragtag. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis of mapping-based and reference-guided genome assembly methods, we shed light on the specific contributions of reference-guided assembly in reducing assembly errors and improving assembly continuity and integrity. These advancements establish reference-guided assembly and the utilization of in silico libraries as a promising and suitable approach for comparative genomics studies.",genome

However, it is difficult to obtain their high-quality whole genomes because of the prevalence of polyploidy and/or high genomic heterozygosity. Whole genomes of 123 medicinal plants were published until September 2022. These published genome sequences were investigated in this review, covering their classification, research teams, ploidy, medicinal functions, and sequencing strategies. More than 1,000 institutes or universities around the world and 50 countries are conducting research on medicinal plant genomes. Diploid species account for a majority of sequenced medicinal plants. The whole genomes of plants in the Poaceae family are the most studied. Almost 40% of the published papers studied species with tonifying, replenishing, and heat-cleaning medicinal effects. Medicinal plants are still in the process of domestication as compared with crops, thereby resulting in unclear genetic backgrounds and the lack of pure lines, thus making their genomes more difficult to complete. In addition, there is still no clear routine framework for a medicinal plant to obtain a high-quality whole genome. Herein, a clear and complete strategy has been originally proposed for creating a high-quality whole genome of medicinal plants. Moreover, whole genome-based biological studies of medicinal plants, including breeding and biosynthesis, were reviewed. We also advocate that a research platform of model medicinal plants should be established to promote the genomics research of medicinal plants.",genome

Recently, it has become an emerging pathogen in humans. However, the complete genome sequence of genus Cysteiniphilum is lacking, and the genomic characteristics of genetic diversity, evolutionary dynamics, and pathogenicity have not been characterized. In this study, the complete genome of the first reported clinical isolate QT6929 of genus Cysteiniphilum was sequenced, and comparative genomics analyses to Francisella genus were conducted to unveil the genomic landscape and diversity of the genus Cysteiniphilum. Our results showed that the complete genome of QT6929 consists of one 2.61 Mb chromosome and a 76,819 bp plasmid. The calculated average nucleotide identity and DNA-DNA hybridization values revealed that two clinical isolates QT6929 and JM-1 should be reclassified as two novel species in genus Cysteiniphilum. Pan-genome analysis revealed genomic diversity within the genus Cysteiniphilum and an open pan-genome state. Genomic plasticity analysis exhibited abundant mobile genetic elements including genome islands, insertion sequences, prophages, and plasmids on Cysteiniphilum genomes, which facilitated the broad exchange of genetic material between Cysteiniphilum and other genera like Francisella and Legionella. Several potential virulence genes associated with lipopolysaccharide/lipooligosaccharide, capsule, and haem biosynthesis specific to clinical isolates were predicted and might contribute to their pathogenicity in humans. Incomplete Francisella pathogenicity island was identified in most Cysteiniphilum genomes. Overall, our study provides an updated phylogenomic relationship of members of the genus Cysteiniphilum and comprehensive genomic insights into this rare emerging pathogen.",genome

But how genome-wide sequence divergence maps to species status is far from clear. While gene sequence divergence is commonly used to delineate bacterial species, its correspondence to established species boundaries has yet to be explored across eukaryotic taxa. Because the processes underlying gene flow differ fundamentally between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, these domains are likely to differ in the relationship between reproductive isolation and genome-wide sequence divergence. In prokaryotes, homologous recombination, the basis of gene flow, depends directly on the degree of genomic sequence divergence, whereas in sexually reproducing eukaryotes, reproductive incompatibility can stem from changes in very few genes. Guided by measures of genome-wide sequence divergence in bacteria, we gauge how genomic criteria correspond to species boundaries in eukaryotes. In recognized species of eukaryotes, levels of gene sequence divergence within species are typically very small, averaging 1% genome-wide sequence divergence are likely separate species, whereas prokaryotic populations with 1% divergence are still able to recombine and thus can be considered the same species.",genome

In this context, GC% can provide insights into virus-host relationships and evolution. Here, we present a comprehensive gene-by-gene analysis of 61 representatives belonging to the phylum Nucleocytoviricota, which comprises viruses with the largest genomes known in the virosphere. Parameters were evaluated not only based on the average GC% of a given viral species compared to the entire phylum but also considering gene position and phylogenetic history. Our results reveal that while some families exhibit similar GC% among their representatives (e.g., Marseilleviridae), others such as Poxviridae, Phycodnaviridae, and Mimiviridae have members with discrepant GC% values, likely reflecting adaptation to specific biological cycles and hosts. Interestingly, certain genes located at terminal regions or within specific genomic clusters show GC% values distinct from the average, suggesting recent acquisition or unique evolutionary pressures. Horizontal gene transfer and the presence of potential paralogs were also assessed in genes with the most discrepant GC% values, indicating multiple evolutionary histories. Taken together, to the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first global and gene-by-gene analysis of GC% distribution and profiles within genomes of Nucleocytoviricota members, highlighting their diversity and identifying potential new targets for future studies.",genome

While these species appear morphologically identical, differences exist in the genetic makeup, geographical range, and possibly the clinical presentation of infection. Here, we show genetic divergence between the cryptic species through both a Blastomyces species tree constructed from orthologous protein sequences and whole genome single-nucleotide variant phylogenomic analysis. Following linked-read sequencing and de novo genome assembly, we characterized and compared the genomes of 3 B. dermatitidis and 3 B. gilchristii isolates. The B. gilchristii genomes (73.25-75.4 Mb) were ∼8 Mb larger than the B. dermatitidis genomes (64.88-66.61 Mb). Average nucleotide identity was lower between genomes of different species than genomes of the same species, yet functional classification of genes suggested similar proteomes. The most striking difference involved long terminal repeat retrotransposons. Although the same retrotransposon elements were detected in the genomes, the quantity of elements differed between the 2 species. Gypsy retrotransposon content was significantly higher in B. gilchristii (38.04-39.26 Mb) than in B. dermatitidis (30.85-32.40 Mb), accounting for the majority of genome size difference between species. Age estimation and phylogenetic analysis of the reverse transcriptase domains suggested that these retrotransposons are relatively ancient, with genome insertion predating the speciation of B. dermatitidis and B. gilchristii. We postulate that different trajectories of genome contraction led to genetic incompatibility, reproductive isolation, and speciation, highlighting the role of transposable elements in fungal evolution.",genome

Recently proposed models yielded promising results for the task of genome sequence classification. Nevertheless, these models often ignore the sequential nature of nucleotides, which is crucial for revealing their underlying structure and function. To address this limitation, we present SPM4GAC, a sequential pattern mining (SPM)-based framework to analyze and classify the macromolecule genome sequences of viruses. First, a large dataset containing the genome sequences of various RNA viruses is developed and transformed into a suitable format. On the transformed dataset, algorithms for SPM are used to identify frequent sequential patterns of nucleotide bases. The obtained frequent sequential patterns of bases are then used as features to classify different viruses. Ten classifiers are employed, and their performance is assessed by using several evaluation measures. Finally, a performance comparison of SPM4GAC with state-of-the-art methods for genome sequence classification/detection reveals that SPM4GAC performs better than those methods.",genome

Despite the high mortality associated with Chagas, relatively few parasite genomes have been assembled to date, with genome assemblies unavailable even for some commonly used laboratory strains. This is at least partially due to T. cruzi's highly complex and highly repetitive genome, which defies investigation using traditional short-read sequencing methods. In this study, we have generated a high-quality whole-genome assembly of the hybrid Tulahuen strain, a commercially available type VI strain, using long-read Nanopore sequencing without short-read scaffolding. The assembled genome contains 25% repeat regions, 17% variable multigene family members, and 27% transposable elements (TEs) and is of comparable quality with T. cruzi genome assemblies that utilized both long- and short-read data. Notably, we find that regions with TEs are significantly enriched for multicopy surface proteins, and that surface proteins are, on average, closer to TEs than to other coding regions. This finding suggests that mobile genetic elements such as transposons may drive recombination within surface protein gene families.

In this perspective, we consider a possible role for discordance between gene trees and species trees in the interpretation of phylogenetic signal in studies of community ecology. Modern genomic data show that the evolutionary histories of many taxa are better described by a patchwork of histories that vary along the genome rather than a single species tree. If a subset of genomic loci harbour trait-related genetic variation, then the phylogeny at these loci may be more informative of interspecific trait differences than the genome background. We develop a simple method to detect loci harbouring phylogenetic signal and demonstrate its application through a proof-of-principle analysis of Penicillium genomes and pairwise interaction strength. Our results show that phylogenetic signal that may be masked genome-wide could be detectable using phylogenomic techniques and may provide a window into the genetic basis for interspecific interactions.",genome

The abundance of functional categories across genomes has previously been found to show power law scaling with respect to the total number of functional categories, suggesting that universal constraints shape genomic category abundance. Here, we look across the tree of life to understand how genome evolution may be related to functional scaling. We revisit previous observations of functional genome scaling with an expanded taxonomy by analyzing 3,726 bacterial, 220 archaeal, and 79 unicellular eukaryotic genomes. We find that for some functional classes, scaling is best described by multiple exponents, revealing previously unobserved shifts in scaling as genome-encoded protein annotations increase or decrease. Furthermore, we find that scaling varies between phyletic groups at both the domain and phyla levels and is less universal than previously thought. This variability in functional scaling is not related to taxonomic phylogeny resolved at the phyla level, suggesting that differences in cell plan or physiology outweigh broad patterns of taxonomic evolution. Since genomes are maintained and replicated by the functional proteins encoded by them, these results point to functional degeneracy between taxonomic groups and unique evolutionary trajectories toward these. We also find that individual phyla frequently span scaling exponents of functional classes, revealing that individual clades can move across scaling exponents. Together, our results reveal unique shifts in functions across the tree of life and highlight that as genomes grow or shrink, proteins of various functions may be added or lost.",genome

Large genome size may be associated with lower selection efficiency because lower effective population sizes allow fixation of deleterious mutations via genetic drift, increasing genome size and decreasing selection efficiency. Because of a hypothesized negative relationship between genome size and recombination rate per base pair, increased genome size could also increase the effect of linked selection in the genome, decreasing the efficiency with which natural selection can fix or remove mutations. We used a transcriptomic dataset of 15 and a subset of six Neotropical salamander species ranging in genome size from 12 to 87 pg to study the relationship between genome size and efficiency of selection. We estimated dN/dS of salamanders with small and large genomes and tested for relaxation of selection in the larger genomes. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find a significant relationship between genome size and selection efficiency or strong evidence for higher dN/dS values in species with larger genomes for either species set. We also found little evidence for relaxation of selection in species with larger genomes. A positive correlation between genome size and range size (a proxy of population size) in this group disagrees with predictions of stronger drift in species with larger genomes.

Schonl. is a very small annual plant growing along riverbanks. Chloroplast (cp) genomes, crucial for photosynthesis, are highly conserved and play a key role in understanding plant evolution. In this study, we conducted cp genome analysis of C. aquatica, aiming to elucidate its phylogenetic position and structural variations. We analyzed and described the features of the complete cp genome of C. aquatica and conducted comparative analysis with the cp genomes of closely related taxa. The cp genome was 144,503 bp in length and exhibited the typical quadripartite structure, consisting of a large single-copy region (LSC; 77,993 bp), a small single-copy region (SSC; 16,784 bp), and two inverted repeats (24,863 bp). The cp genome of C. aquatica comprised 113 unique genes, including 79 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 30 tRNAs, and 4 rRNA genes. Comparative genomic analysis of 13 other Crassula species and six outgroups demonstrated highly conserved gene content and order among Crassula species. However, notable differences were observed, including the complete loss of the rpoC1 intron in C. aquatica and several closely related species, which may serve as a synapomorphic trait supporting the monophyly of the subgenus Disporocarpa. We analyzed the nucleotide diversity among 14 Crassula cp genomes and identified five highly variable regions (pi > 0.08) in the IGS regions. Phylogenetic analysis based on 78 PCGs confirmed the monophyly of Crassula and its division into two subgenera: Crassula and Disporocarpa. Although the phylogenetic tree supported the subgeneric classification system, the sectional classification system requires reassessment. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the cp genome of the genus Crassula.

Recent work has demonstrated that significant biases may be introduced into downstream phylogenetic analyses from processing genomic data; however, it remains unclear whether there are interactions among bioinformatic parameters or biases introduced through the choice of reference genome for sequence alignment and variant calling. We address these knowledge gaps by employing a combination of simulated and empirical data sets to investigate the extent to which the choice of reference genome in upstream bioinformatic processing of genomic data influences phylogenetic inference, as well as the way that reference genome choice interacts with bioinformatic filtering choices and phylogenetic inference method. We demonstrate that more stringent minor allele filters bias inferred trees away from the true species tree topology, and that these biased trees tend to be more imbalanced and have a higher center of gravity than the true trees. We find the greatest topological accuracy when filtering sites for minor allele count (MAC) >3-4 in our 51-taxa data sets, while tree center of gravity was closest to the true value when filtering for sites with MAC >1-2. In contrast, filtering for missing data increased accuracy in the inferred topologies; however, this effect was small in comparison to the effect of minor allele filters and may be undesirable due to a subsequent mutation spectrum distortion. The bias introduced by these filters differs based on the reference genome used in short read alignment, providing further support that choosing a reference genome for alignment is an important bioinformatic decision with implications for downstream analyses. These results demonstrate that attributes of the study system and dataset (and their interaction) add important nuance for how best to assemble and filter short-read genomic data for phylogenetic inference.",genome

Multiple different methods are currently used to cluster together closely related genomes, potentially leading to inconsistency between studies. Here, we use a global dataset of 26 306 Streptococcus pneumoniae genomes to compare four clustering methods: gene-by-gene seven-locus MLST, core genome MLST (cgMLST)-based hierarchical clustering (HierCC) assignments, life identification number (LIN) barcoding and k-mer-based PopPUNK clustering (known as GPSCs in this species). We compare the clustering results with phylogenetic and pan-genome analyses to assess their relationship with genome diversity and evolution, as we would expect a good clustering method to form a single monophyletic cluster that has high within-cluster similarity of genomic content. We show that the four methods are generally able to accurately reflect the population structure based on these metrics and that the methods were broadly consistent with each other. We investigated further to study the discrepancies in clusters. The greatest concordance was seen between LIN barcoding and HierCC (adjusted mutual information score=0.950), which was expected given that both methods utilize cgMLST, but have different methods for defining an individual cluster and different core genome schema. However, the existence of differences between the two methods shows that the selection of a core genome schema can introduce inconsistencies between studies. GPSC and HierCC assignments were also highly concordant (AMI=0.946), showing that k-mer-based methods which use the whole genome and do not require the careful selection of a core genome schema are just as effective at representing the population structure. Additionally, where there were differences in clustering between these methods, this could be explained by differences in the accessory genome that were not identified in cgMLST. We conclude that for S. pneumoniae, standardized and stable nomenclature is important as the number of genomes available expands. Furthermore, the research community should transition away from seven-locus MLST, whilst cgMLST, GPSC and LIN assignments should be used more widely. However, to allow for easy comparison between studies and to make previous literature relevant, the reporting of multiple clustering names should be standardized within the research.",genome

China has the world's largest aquaculture industry in terms of production volume. However, the sustainable development of fish culture is hindered by several concerns, including germplasm degradation and disease outbreaks. The practice of genomic breeding, which relies heavily on genome information and genotypephenotype relationships, has significant potential for increasing the efficiency of aquaculture production. In 2014, the completion of the genome sequencing and annotation of the Chinese tongue sole signified the beginning of the fish genomics era in China. Since then, domestic researchers have made dramatic progress in functional genomic studies. To date, the genomes of more than 60 species of fish in China have been assembled and annotated. Based on these reference genomes, evolutionary, comparative, and functional genomic studies have revolutionized our understanding of a wide range of biologically and economically important traits of fishes, including growth and development, sex determination, disease resistance, metamorphosis, and pigmentation. Furthermore, genomic tools and breeding techniques such as SNP arrays, genomic selection, and genome editing have greatly accelerated genetic improvement through the incorporation of functional genomic information into breeding activities. This review aims to summarize the current status, advances, and perspectives of the genome resources, genomic study of important traits, and genomic breeding techniques of fish in China. The review will provide aquaculture researchers, fish breeders, and farmers with updated information concerning fish genomic research and breeding technology. The summary will help to promote the genetic improvement of production traits and thus will support the sustainable development of fish aquaculture.",genome

While numerous genomic island detection methods have been proposed, there has been limited evaluation of the efficiency of the genome information processing and boundary recognition tools. In this study, we conducted a review of the statistical methods involved in genomic signatures, host signature extraction, informative signature selection, divergence measures, and boundary detection steps in genomic island prediction. We compared the performances of these methods on simulated experiments using alien fragments obtained from both artificial and real genomes. Our results indicate that among the nine genomic signatures evaluated, genomic signature frequency and full probability performed the best. However, their performance declined when normalized to their expectations and variances, such as Z-score and composition vector. Based on our experiments of the E. coli genome, we found that the confidence intervals of the window variances achieved the best performance in the signature extraction of the host, with the best confidence interval being 1.5-2 times the standard error. Ordered kurtosis was most effective in selecting informative signatures from a single genome, without requiring prior knowledge from other datasets. Among the three divergence measures evaluated, the two-sample t-test was the most successful, and a non-overlapping window with a small eye window (size 2) was best suited for identifying compositionally distinct regions. Finally, the maximum of the Markovian Jensen-Shannon divergence score, in terms of GC-content bias, was found to make boundary detection faster while maintaining a similar error rate.",genome

However, marker-assisted selection has proven its potential for improving qualitative traits with large effects regulated by one to few genes. Its contribution to the improvement of the quantitative traits regulated by a number of small-effect genes is modest. In this context, genomic selection (GS) has been regarded as the most promising method for genetically enhancing complicated features that are regulated by several genes, each of which has minor effects. By examining a population's phenotypes and high-density marker scores, genomic selection can forecast the breeding potential of individual lines. The fact that GS uses all marker data in the prediction model prevents skewed marker effect estimations and maximizes the amount of variation caused by small-effect QTL. It has the ability to speed up the breeding cycle and as a consequence of which superior genotypes are selected rapidly. Developing the best GS models while taking into account non-additive effects, genotype-by-environment interaction, and cost-effectiveness will enable the widespread implementation of GS in plants. These steps will also increase heritability estimation and prediction accuracy. This review focuses on the shift from conventional selection methods to GS, underlying statistical tools and methodologies, the state of GS research in agricultural plants, and prospects for its effective use in the creation of climate-resilient crops.",genome

Many commercial SNP arrays were originally designed for Bos taurus taurus, leading to ascertainment bias and the exclusion of crucial SNPs specific to Zebu populations. This review assesses progress in SNP array and reference genome development, with a focus on efforts tailored to Zebu populations and their impact on genomic selection and breeding efficiency. We reviewed the relevant literature on the development of SNP arrays, reference genome assemblies, and SNP genotyping techniques used for Zebu cattle. Emphasis was placed on SNP arrays specifically designed for Zebu breeds, evaluating their contributions to genomic evaluations and identifying limitations in prediction accuracy. Recent advancements, such as GeneSeek's low- and high-density SNP panels, have aimed to reduce ascertainment bias and include key SNPs for Zebu populations by providing breed-specific panels. These panels have been instrumental in identifying genomic regions associated with economically important traits in Nellore cattle. Studies show that tailored SNP arrays and breed-specific reference genomes can enhance genetic diversity assessment and improve genomic predictions, supporting more effective breeding programs for Zebu cattle. Improved SNP arrays and breed-specific reference genomes are crucial for accurate genomic selection in Zebu cattle. Future efforts should prioritize expanding de novo genome assemblies, reducing ascertainment bias, and developing cost-effective genotyping solutions tailored to Zebu populations. Targeted genomic tools will ultimately enable more efficient breeding practices and enhance genomic selection for economically important traits in B. t. indicus cattle.",genome

Here, we report the isolation and genome sequencing of 2 Pithoviridae from soil samples, in addition to 3 other recent isolates.

We also found that Pithoviridae genomes are more conservative than other families of giant viruses, with a low and stable proportion (5% to 7%) of genes originating from horizontal transfers. Genome size variation within the family is mainly due to variations in gene duplication rates (from 14% to 28%) and massive invasion by inverted repeats.

Since vast knowledge has already accumulated in the past two decades with inconsistent nomenclature, the insights gained on a genome could not be easily extendable to other genomes. Therefore, the present study aims to perform comparative genomics studies in WSSV on uniform nomenclature. We have combined the standard mummer tool with custom scripts to develop missing regions finder (MRF) that documents the missing genome regions and coding sequences in virus genomes in comparison to a reference genome and in its annotation nomenclature. The procedure was implemented as web tool and in command-line interface. Using MRF, we have documented the missing coding sequences in WSSV and explored their role in virulence through application of phylogenomics, machine learning models and homologous genes. We have tabulated and depicted the missing genome regions, missing coding sequences and deletion hotspots in WSSV on a common annotation nomenclature and attempted to link them to virus virulence. It was observed that the ubiquitination, transcription regulation and nucleotide metabolism might be essentially required for WSSV pathogenesis; and the structural proteins, VP19, VP26 and VP28 are essential for virus assembly. Few minor structural proteins in WSSV would act as envelope glycoproteins. We have also demonstrated the advantage of MRF in providing detailed graphic/tabular output in less time and also in handling of low-complexity, repeat-rich and highly similar regions of the genomes using other virus cases. Pathogenic virus research benefits from tools that could directly indicate the missing genomic regions and coding sequences between isolates/strains. In virus research, the analyses performed in this study provides an advancement to find the differences between genomes and to quickly identify the important coding sequences/genomes that require early attention from researchers.

However, genomic complexity is one of the primary impediments to trait mining and characterization. Multiple reference genomes and cutting-edge technologies like haplotype mapping, genomic selection, precise gene editing tools, high-throughput phenotyping platforms, high-efficiency genetic transformation systems, and speed-breeding facilities are transforming wheat functional genomics research to understand the genomic diversity of polyploidy. This review focuses on the research achievements in wheat genomics, the available omics approaches, and bioinformatic resources developed in the past decades. Advances in genomics and system biology approaches are highlighted to circumvent bottlenecks in genomic and phenotypic selection, as well as gene transfer. In addition, we propose conducting precise functional genomic studies and developing sustainable breeding strategies for wheat.

Although there has been some progress in the phylogeny of Chrysosplenium over the years, the phylogenetic position of some species is still controversial. In this study, we assembled chloroplast genomes (cp genomes) of 34 Chrysosplenium species and performed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses in combination with other cp genomes of previously known Chrysosplenium species, for a total of 44 Chrysosplenium species. The comparative analyses revealed that cp genomes of Chrysosplenium species were more conserved in terms of genome structure, gene content and arrangement, SSRs, and codon preference, but differ in genome size and SC/IR boundaries. Phylogenetic analysis showed that cp genomes effectively improved the phylogenetic support and resolution of Chrysosplenium species and strongly supported Chrysosplenium species as a monophyletic taxon and divided into three branches. The results also showed that the sections of Alternifolia and Oppositifolia were not monophyletic with each other, and that C. microspermum was not clustered with other Chrysosplenium species with alternate leaves, but with C. sedakowii into separate branches. In addition, we identified 10 mutational hotspot regions that could serve as potential DNA barcodes for Chrysosplenium species identification. In contrast to Peltoboykinia, the clpP and ycf2 genes of Chrysosplenium were subjected to positive selection and had multiple significant positive selection sites. We further detected a significant positive selection site on the petG gene between the two sections of Chrysosplenium.

We used chromosomal-level assemblies from eight Fusarium graminearum isolates to study structural variants and their role in fungal evolution. We generated the assemblies of four of these genomes after Oxford Nanopore sequencing. A total of 87 inversions, 159 translocations, 245 duplications, 58,489 insertions, and 34,102 deletions were detected. Regions of high recombination rate are associated with structural rearrangements, and a significant proportion of inversions, translocations, and duplications overlap with the repeat content of the genome, suggesting recombination and repeat elements are major factors in the origin of structural rearrangements in F. graminearum. Large insertions and deletions introduce presence-absence polymorphisms for many genes, including secondary metabolite biosynthesis cluster genes and predicted effectors genes. Translocation events were found to be shuffling predicted effector-rich regions of the genomes and are likely contributing to the gain and loss of effectors facilitated by recombination. Breakpoints of some structural rearrangements fall within coding sequences and are likely altering the protein products. Structural rearrangements in F. graminearum thus have an important role to play in shaping pathogen-host interactions and broader evolution through genome reorganization, the introduction of presence-absence polymorphisms, and changing protein products and gene regulation.",genome

We redefine the relationships across populations with an arbitrary base of a maximum heterozygosity population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Then, the relationship between or within populations is a cross-product of the form Γ b , b ' = 2 n 2 p b - 1 2 p b ' - 1 ' with p being vectors of allele frequencies at n markers in populations b and b ' .

However, the identification of species-specific fixed genetic variants requires the analysis of genomes from multiple individuals. Moreover, the long-term scale of adaptive evolution coupled with the short-term nature of traditional time series data has made it difficult to assess when different adaptations evolved. Here, we analyze 23 woolly mammoth genomes, including one of the oldest known specimens at 700,000 years old, to identify fixed derived non-synonymous mutations unique to the species and to obtain estimates of when these mutations evolved. We find that at the time of its origin, the woolly mammoth had already acquired a broad spectrum of positively selected genes, including ones associated with hair and skin development, fat storage and metabolism, and immune system function. Our results also suggest that these phenotypes continued to evolve during the last 700,000 years, but through positive selection on different sets of genes. Finally, we also identify additional genes that underwent comparatively recent positive selection, including multiple genes related to skeletal morphology and body size, as well as one gene that may have contributed to the small ear size in Late Quaternary woolly mammoths.",genome

Due to multiple complex adaptive and neutral forces which impose evolutionary pressures on genomes, there is a huge variability of genomic features. However, their variability and the extent to which genomic content determines the distribution of recovered loci in reduced representation sequencing studies is largely unexplored. Here, by using 80 genome assemblies, we observed that whereas plants primarily increase their genome size by expanding their intergenic regions, animals expand both intergenic and intronic regions, although the expansion patterns differ between deuterostomes and protostomes. Loci mapping in introns, exons, and intergenic categories obtained by in silico digestion using 2b-enzymes are positively correlated with the percentage of these regions in the corresponding genomes, suggesting that loci distribution mostly mirrors genomic architecture of the selected taxon. However, exonic regions showed a significant enrichment of loci in all groups regardless of the used enzyme. Moreover, when using selective adaptors to obtain a secondarily reduced loci dataset, the percentage and distribution of retained loci also varied. Adaptors with G/C terminals recovered a lower percentage of selected loci, with a further enrichment of exonic regions, while adaptors with A/T terminals retained a higher percentage of loci and slightly selected more intronic regions than expected. Our results highlight how genome composition, genome GC content, RAD enzyme choice and use of base-selective adaptors influence reduced genome representation techniques. This is important to acknowledge in population and conservation genomic studies, as it determines the abundance and distribution of loci.",genome

Notably, our data show that the Alpine population, characterized by strong differentiation and reduced genetic diversity, is reproductively isolated from other regions and likely represents a differentiated evolutionary significant unit (ESU).

This ""noise"" in expression derives from several sources, including the genomic and cellular environment in which a gene resides. Large-scale maps of genomic environments have revealed the effects of epigenetic modifications and transcription factor occupancy on mean expression levels, but leveraging such maps to explain expression noise will require new methods to assay how expression noise changes at locations across the genome. To address this gap, we present Single-cell Analysis of Reporter Gene Expression Noise and Transcriptome (SARGENT), a method that simultaneously measures the noisiness of reporter genes integrated throughout the genome and the global mRNA profiles of individual reporter-gene-containing cells. Using SARGENT, we perform the first comprehensive genome-wide survey of how genomic locations impact gene expression noise. We find that the mean and noise of expression correlate with different histone modifications. We quantify the intrinsic and extrinsic components of reporter gene noise and, using the associated mRNA profiles, assign the extrinsic component to differences between the CD24+ ""stem-like"" substate and the more ""differentiated"" substate. SARGENT also reveals the effects of transgene integrations on endogenous gene expression, which will help guide the search for ""safe-harbor"" loci.

However, significant knowledge gaps exist in understanding the detailed mechanisms for this hardwood-pathogenic fungus. To address this issue, five monokaryotic P. fraxinea strains, SS1 to SS5, were isolated from the tree species Robinia pseudoacacia, and high polysaccharide-degrading activities and the fastest growth were found for P. fraxinea SS3 among the isolates. The whole genome of P. fraxinea SS3 was sequenced, and its unique CAZyme potential for tree pathogenicity was determined in comparison to the genomes of other nonpathogenic Polyporales. These CAZyme features are well conserved in a distantly related tree pathogen, Heterobasidion annosum. Furthermore, the carbon source-dependent CAZyme secretions of P. fraxinea SS3 and a nonpathogenic and strong white-rot Polyporales member, Phanerochaete chrysosporium RP78, were compared by activity measurements and proteomic analyses. As seen in the genome comparisons, P. fraxinea SS3 exhibited higher pectin-degrading activities and higher laccase activities than P. chrysosporium RP78, which were attributed to the secretion of abundant glycoside hydrolase family 28 (GH28) pectinases and auxiliary activity family 1_1 (AA1_1) laccases, respectively. These enzymes are possibly related to fungal invasion into the tree lumens and the detoxification of tree defense substances. Additionally, P. fraxinea SS3 showed secondary cell wall degradation capabilities at the same level as that of P. chrysosporium RP78. Overall, this study suggested mechanisms for how this fungus can attack the cell walls of living trees as a serious pathogen and differs from other nonpathogenic white-rot fungi. IMPORTANCE Many studies have been done to understand the mechanisms underlying the degradation of plant cell walls of dead trees by wood decay fungi. However, little is known about how some of these fungi weaken living trees as pathogens. P. fraxinea belongs to the Polyporales, a group of strong wood decayers, and is known to aggressively attack and fell standing hardwood trees all over the world. Here, we report CAZymes potentially related to plant cell wall degradation and pathogenesis factors in a newly isolated fungus, P. fraxinea SS3, by genome sequencing in conjunction with comparative genomic and secretomic analyses. The present study provides insights into the mechanisms of the degradation of standing hardwood trees by the tree pathogen, which will contribute to the prevention of this serious tree disease.",genome
