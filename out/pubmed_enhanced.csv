To understand the pattern of sugar accumulation during chestnut nut development, the related enzyme gene regulatory pathways, and the molecular regulatory mechanisms of chestnut sugar biosynthesis metabolism, two chestnut varieties with different sugar content, namely Chengbu Youzhu (hereinafter referred to as CBYZ) and AnYou No. 1 (hereinafter referred to as AY01), were selected for investigation. Total sugar and starch content, and the activity of enzymes related to sugar accumulation, were measured in the nuts of the two chestnut varieties 10 days after flowering (DAF), 20 DAF, 30 DAF, 40 DAF, 50 DAF, 60 DAF, 70 DAF, 80 DAF, and 90 DAF. Changes in starch, straight-chain starch, and branched-chain starch content, and sucrose-phosphate synthase, soluble starch synthase, and granule-bound starch synthase enzyme activities were consistent with one-another. A total of 24 differentially expressed genes between the two varieties were associated with sugar biosynthesis and metabolism at three key stages (30, 60, and 90 DAF) of sugar accumulation. Further analysis showing upregulation of the expression of starch-related genes, such as β-amylase, GYS, and INV indicated that these genes were not actively expressed in AY01, resulting in slow accumulation of starch and reduced sugar content. By contrast, the downregulation of the expression of genes, such as PGK and MDH1, indicated that these genes were actively expressed in low-sugar chestnuts, resulting in the rapid fermentation of sugars. A link between gene up- or down-regulation during different developmental stages of chestnut and the effect of their expression on sugar content were established by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. These findings provide further insights into the mechanism of sugar biosynthesis in chestnuts.",Castanea,11.4,Q1,Journal of Integrative Plant Biology

Dicer recognizes and cleaves virus-derived double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and/or structured single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) into small-interfering RNAs, which guide effector Argonaute to homologous viral RNAs for digestion and inhibit virus replication. Thus, Argonaute is believed to be essential for antiviral RNAi. Here, we show Argonaute-independent, Dicer-dependent antiviral defense against dsRNA viruses using Cryphonectria parasitica (chestnut blight fungus), which is a model filamentous ascomycetous fungus and hosts a variety of viruses. The fungus has two dicer-like genes (dcl1 and dcl2) and four argonaute-like genes (agl1 to agl4). We prepared a suite of single to quadruple agl knockout mutants with or without dcl disruption. We tested these mutants for antiviral activities against diverse dsRNA viruses and ssRNA viruses. Although both DCL2 and AGL2 worked as antiviral players against some RNA viruses, DCL2 without argonaute was sufficient to block the replication of other RNA viruses. Overall, these results indicate the existence of a Dicer-alone defense and different degrees of susceptibility to it among RNA viruses. We discuss what determines the great difference in susceptibility to the Dicer-only defense.",chestnut,11.1,Q1,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

Autophagy plays a crucial role in maintaining muscle health. There is growing interest in leveraging autophagy to mitigate muscle ageing effects. The impact of natural autophagy activators on skeletal muscle ageing remains elusive. This study aims to identify natural autophagy activators and assess their effects on skeletal muscle ageing. To discover novel autophagy activators, we screened 493 natural products and identified Castanea crenata flower extract (CCFE) as a promising candidate. We investigated the effect of CCFE on cellular senescence in C2C12 cells induced by etoposide. In animal experiments, aged mice (18 months old) were fed a diet supplemented with 0.1% and 0.2% CCFE for 3 months. We assessed exercise capacity, mitochondrial function and autophagic flux to determine the impact of CCFE on skeletal muscle ageing. The components present in CCFE were analysed using LC-MS/MS, and their functional properties were examined. CCFE enhanced autophagic flux (LC3II 80% increase, p < 0.05) and reduced senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (32.78% decrease, p < 0.001). In aged mice, a 3-month supplementation with CCFE improved muscle weight (18% increase, p < 0.05) and function (treadmill performance increased by 60%, p < 0.5; grip strength increased by 25%, p < 0.05). It alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction (basal oxygen consumption rate increased by 59%, p < 0.05) and restored autophagy. CCFE enhanced autophagy by activating AMPK (80% increase, p < 0.01) and inhibiting Atg5 protein acetylation (65% decrease, p < 0.001), with contributions from ellagic acid and polyamines. CCFE supplementation restored polyamine levels (serum spermidine increased from 0.98 ± 0.08 to 2.22 ± 0.05 μg/mL, p < 0.001) and increased urolithin levels (serum urolithin A increased from 0 to 18.79 ± 0.062 ng/mL, p < 0.001), metabolites produced by the gut microbiome from ellagic acid in aged mice. CCFE effectively suppressed skeletal muscle ageing by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and restoring autophagic flux in aged mice.

These trees are currently found around the globe, demonstrating their genetic adaptation to different environmental conditions. Several biotic and abiotic stresses have challenged these species, contributing to the decline of European chestnut production and the functional extinction of the American chestnut. Several efforts started over the last century to understand the cellular, molecular, and genetic interactions behind all chestnut biotic and abiotic interactions. Most efforts have been toward breeding for the primary diseases, chestnut blight and ink disease caused by the pathogens, Cryphonectria parasitica and Phytophthora cinnamomi, respectively. In Europe and North America, researchers have been using the Asian chestnut species, which co-evolved with the pathogens, to introgress resistance genes into the susceptible species. Breeding woody trees has several limitations which can be mostly related to the long life cycles of these species and the big genome landscapes. Consequently, it takes decades to improve traits of interest, such as resistance to pathogens. Currently, the availability of genome sequences and next-generation sequencing techniques may provide new tools to help overcome most of the problems tree breeding is still facing. This review summarizes European and American chestnut's main biotic stresses and discusses breeding and biotechnological efforts developed over the last decades, having ink disease and chestnut blight as the main focus.

In order to improve the antioxidant activity of chestnut polysaccharide, chestnut polysaccharide (CP) was extracted by ultrasonic-assisted water extraction and alcohol precipitation and purified by cellulose DEAE-52 exchange and Sephadex G-100 chromatography in this study. CP isolates were characterized by I2-KI reaction, three-strand helical structure analysis, infrared spectrum analysis, and nuclear magnetic resonance detection. The results showed that CP is a pyrylan sugar with triple helical structure and connected by α-glycosidic bonds, with sugar residues 1,4-α-D-Glcp, 1,6-α-D-Galp, 1,5-α-L-Araf, 1,4-α-L-Rhap, and 1,4-β-D-Glcp in the CP backbone. After purification, the branching structure, rod, and spherical structure were significantly increased, with reduced lamellar structure. The in vitro scavenging rates of CP at 10 mg·mL-1 against DPPH, hydroxyl radicals, and ABTS were 88.95, 41.38, and 48.16%, respectively. The DPPH free radical scavenging rate of purified polysaccharide fraction CP-1a was slightly enhanced, and the other rates showed a small decrease. Selenized chestnut polysaccharide (CP-Se) was prepared using nano-selenium method. The selenization method was optimized and stable Se-CP was obtained. When the concentration was 5 mg·mL-1, Se-CP had significantly higher scavenging abilities 89.81 ± 2.33, 58.50 ± 1.60, and 40.66 ± 1.91% for DPPH, hydroxyl radical, and ABTS radicals, respectively, than those of CP. The results of this study provide insight into the effects purification and selenization of chestnut polysaccharide on antioxidant activity, and also provide a theoretical basis for the development of chestnut polysaccharide for use in functional foods or health products.",chestnut,5.6,Q1,Frontiers in Plant Science

Although individual chestnut species differ greatly, the molecular basis of the formation of their characteristic traits remains unknown. Though the draft genomes of chestnut have been previously released, the pan-genome of different variety needs to be studied. We report the genome sequence of three cultivated varieties of chestnut herein, namely Hei-Shan-Zhai-7 (H7, drought-resistant variety), Yan-Hong (YH, easy-pruning variety), and Yan-Shan-Zao-Sheng (ZS, early-maturing variety), to expedite convenience and efficiency in its genetics-based breeding. We obtained three chromosome-level chestnut genome assemblies through a combination of Oxford Nanopore technology, Illumina HiSeq X, and Hi-C mapping. The final genome assemblies are 671.99 Mb (YH), 790.99 Mb (ZS), and 678.90 Mb (H7), across 12 chromosomes, with scaffold N50 sizes of 50.50 Mb (YH), 65.05 Mb (ZS), and 52.16 Mb (H7). Through the identification of homologous genes and the cluster analysis of gene families, we found that H7, YH and ZS had 159, 131, and 91 unique gene families, respectively, and there were 13,248 single-copy direct homologous genes in the three chestnut varieties. For the convenience of research, the chestnut genome database was constructed. Based on the results of gene family identification, the presence/absence variations (PAVs) information of the three sample genes was calculated, and a total of 2,364, 2,232, and 1,475 unique genes were identified in H7, YH and ZS, respectively. Our results suggest that the GBSS II-b gene family underwent expansion in chestnut (relative to nearest source species).

The germination rate of recalcitrant seeds is low in natural habitats and decreases under conditions of desiccation and low temperature. The germination rate of cultivated Chinese chestnut seeds is significantly higher than that of wild seeds. To explore the reasons for the higher germination rate of cultivated seeds in Chinese chestnut, 113,524 structural variants (SVs) between the wild and cultivated Chinese chestnut genomes were detected through genome comparison. Genotyping these SVs in 60 Chinese chestnut accessions identified allele frequency changes during Chinese chestnut domestication, and some SVs are overlapping genes for controlling seed germination. Transcriptome analysis revealed downregulation of the abscisic acid synthesis genes and upregulation of the beta-amylase synthesis genes in strongly selected genes of cultivated seeds. On the other hand, hormone and enzyme activity assays indicated a decrease in endogenous ABA level and an increase in beta-amylase activity in cultivated seeds. These results shed light on the higher germination rate of cultivated seeds. Moreover, phosphatidic acid synthesis genes are highly expressed in seed germination stages of wild Chinese chestnut and may play a role in recalcitrant seed germination. These findings provide new insight into the regulation of wild seed germination and promote natural regeneration and succession in forest ecosystems.",chestnut,5.6,Q1,Frontiers in plant science

However, rapid growth requires a large water consumption, and irrigation water provides a natural means for pathogen spread. That includes members of Phytophthora spp. that have proven to be a global enemy to forests. With the known adaptability to new hosts, it is only a matter of time for more aggressive Phytophthora species to become a threat to poplar forests and plantations. Here, the effects of artificial inoculation with two different representatives of aggressive species (P. cactorum and P. plurivora) were analyzed in the proteome of the Phytophthora-tolerant hybrid poplar clone T-14 [Populus tremula L. 70 × (Populus × canescens (Ait.) Sm. 23)]. Wood microcore samples were collected at the active necrosis borders to provide insight into the molecular processes underlying the observed tolerance to Phytophthora. The analysis revealed the impact of Phytophthora on poplar primary and secondary metabolism, including carbohydrate-active enzymes, amino acid biosynthesis, phenolic metabolism, and lipid metabolism, all of which were confirmed by consecutive metabolome and lipidome profiling. Modulations of enzymes indicating systemic response were confirmed by the analysis of leaf proteome, and sampling of wood microcores in distal locations revealed proteins with abundance correlating with proximity to the infection, including germin-like proteins, components of proteosynthesis, glutamate carboxypeptidase, and an enzyme that likely promotes anthocyanin stability. Finally, the identified Phytophthora-responsive proteins were compared to those previously found in trees with compromised defense against Phytophthora, namely, Quercus spp. and Castanea sativa. That provided a subset of candidate markers of Phytophthora tolerance, including certain ribosomal proteins, auxin metabolism enzymes, dioxygenases, polyphenol oxidases, trehalose-phosphate synthase, mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase, and rhamnose biosynthetic enzymes.

Vaccination is the most effective preventive strategy for ameliorating seasonal influenza. However, the vaccine is not fully effective in cases of antigenic mismatch with the viral strains circulating in the community. The emergence of resistance to antiviral drugs aggravates the situation. Therefore, developing new vaccines and antiviral drugs is essential. Castanea crenata honey (CH) is an extensively cultivated food worldwide and has been used as a nutritional supplement or herbal medicine. However, the potential anti-influenza properties of CH remain unexplored. In this study, the in vitro and in vivo antiviral effects of CH were assessed. CH significantly prevented influenza virus infection in mouse Raw264.7 macrophages. CH pretreatment inhibited the expression of the viral proteins M2, PA, and PB1 and enhanced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and type-I interferon (IFN)-related proteins in vitro. CH increased the expression of RIG-1, mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, and IFN-inducible transmembrane protein, which interferes with virus replication. CH reduced body weight loss by 20.9%, increased survival by 60%, and decreased viral replication and inflammatory response in the lungs of influenza A virus-infected mice. Therefore, CH stimulates an antiviral response in murine macrophages and mice by preventing viral infection through the RIG-1-mediated MAVS pathway.

The molecular mechanism responsible for this phenomenon remains largely unknown. To address this, we performed comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of S. miltiorrhiza and S. castanea. A total of 296 genes in S. castanea and 125 genes in S. miltiorrhiza were highly expressed at both the transcriptional and proteome levels, including hormone signal regulation, fungus response genes, transcription factors, and CYP450. Among these differentially expressed genes, the expression of SmWRKY61 was particularly high in S. castanea. Overexpression of SmWRKY61 in S. miltiorrhiza could significantly increase the content of tanshinone I and tanshinone IIA, which were 11.09 and 33.37 times of the control, respectively. Moreover, SmWRKY61 had a strong regulatory effect, elevating the expression levels of tanshinone pathway genes such as DXS2, CMK, HMGS2, 1, KSL1, KSL2, CYP76AH1, and CYP76AK3.

Here, we investigated temporal changes in genetic diversity of the invasive chestnut blight pathogen Cryphonectria parasitica in the presence of its parasitic mycovirus Cryphonectria hypovirus 1 (CHV1). The virus reduces fungal virulence and represents an effective natural biocontrol agent against chestnut blight in Europe. We analysed genome-wide diversity and CHV1 prevalence in C. parasitica populations in southern Switzerland that were sampled twice at an interval of about 30 years. Overall, we found that both pathogen population structure and CHV1 prevalence were retained over time. The results suggest that recent bottlenecks have influenced the structure of C. parasitica populations in southern Switzerland. Strong balancing selection signals were found at a single vegetative incompatibility (vic) locus, consistent with negative frequency-dependent selection imposed by the vegetative incompatibility system. High levels of mating among related individuals (i.e., inbreeding) and genetic drift are probably at the origin of imbalanced allele ratios at vic loci and subsequently low vc type diversity.

The fungal pathogen attacks chestnut stems by invading wounded tissue and secreting oxalate. This process leads to the death of infected host cells and the formation of cankers, eventually girdling stems and killing the tree above the infections. To reduce damage caused by fungal oxalate, American chestnut has been genetically engineered to express a wheat oxalate oxidase (OxO). This enzyme degrades the oxalate produced by the pathogen and confers elevated tolerance to Cryphonectria parasitica infection. We report new lines of transgenic American chestnut that have been developed with the win3.12 inducible promoter from poplar (Populus deltoides) driving OxO expression. This promoter is responsive to both wounding and pathogen infection, with a low level of baseline expression. Targeted expression of OxO to wounded and infected tissue is sought as an alternative to constitutive expression for potential metabolic resource conservation and transgene stability over the long lifetime of a tree and over successive generations of breeding. Transgenic Castanea dentata lines harbouring the win3.12-OxO construct were evaluated for transgene expression patterns and tolerance to chestnut blight infection.

This research aimed to assess the antifungal properties of perilla essential oil (PEO) and perillaldehyde (PAE) against B. dothidea. PEO's and PAE's inhibitory effects on B. dothidea were investigated using an agar dilution method, a fumigation method, and an in vivo assay in chestnuts and shell buckets. Based on the results of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, it was confirmed that the main component of PEO was elemicin. The antifungal mechanism of PEO and PAE against B. dothidea was investigated by conducting staining experiments of the fungal cell wall and cell membrane. PEO and PAE strongly inhibit the mycelial growth of B. dothidea in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory mechanism is mainly related to the destruction of the integrity of the fungal cell wall and plasma membrane. Notably, PEO retains its antifungal efficacy against B. dothidea in chestnuts, effectively prolonging their storage life. These findings indicate that PEO and PAE are nontoxic, eco-friendly botanical fungicides, holding promise for controlling postharvest chestnut rot.",chestnut,4.7,Q2,Journal of Fungi

Aiming at the existing problems of high labor intensity and low efficiency of manual peeling, a combined water chestnut peeling machine was designed, which used a rotary knife to remove bud and root, and a differential friction belts to remove side peel. The performance of the peeling machine was tested with water chestnut from Xiaogan, Hubei Provence. Under the conditions of 200 g feeding mass and 10 r/min rotation speed, the single factor test was carried out with cutting speed as the influencing factor and the cutting rate of bud and root as the evaluation index. The results showed that the cutting rate of fresh fruit of water chestnut bud and root were 79.04% and 83.77% respectively when the cutting speed of rotary knife was 1.2 m/s. In the differential friction belts, high and low linear velocities were taken as the influencing factors, and the side peel removal rate was used as the evaluation index. The side peel removal rate was 84.93% at the high-speed linear velocity of 2.1 m/s and the low-speed linear velocity of 1.58 m/s. The performance of the whole machine was evaluated, and the results showed that the working loss of the combined water chestnut peeling machine was 43.03% and the comprehensive peeling rate was 77.43%, which reached the design requirements.

North American bat diets remain incompletely described, which is concerning at a time when many bat and insect populations appear to be declining. Understanding the variability in foraging is thus an essential component for effective bat conservation. To comprehensively evaluate local foraging, we assessed the spatial and temporal variability in prey consumed by the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, in New Hampshire, USA. We collected bat guano samples from 20 sites over 2 years and analyzed sequence data for 899 of these samples using a molecular metabarcoding approach targeting the cytochrome oxidase I subunit (COI) gene. Some prey items were broadly shared across locations and sampling dates, with the most frequently detected arthropod orders broadly similar to previous morphological and molecular analyses; at least one representative sequence variant was assigned to Coleoptera in 92% of samples, with other frequently detected orders including Diptera (73%), Lepidoptera (65%), Trichoptera (38%), and Ephemeroptera (32%). More specifically, two turf and forest pests were routinely detected: white grubs in the genus Phyllophaga (50%), and the Asiatic Garden beetle, Maladera castanea (36%). Despite the prevalence of a few taxa shared among many samples and distinct seasonal peaks in consumption of specific arthropods, diet composition varied both temporally and spatially. However, species richness did not strongly vary indicating consumption of a broad diversity of taxa throughout the summer. These data characterize little brown bats as flexible foragers adept at consuming a broad array of locally available prey resources.",Castanea,4.6,Q2,Scientific reports

Consequently, members of this family are involved in a plethora of processes including development and specialized metabolism. The MYB families of many plant species were investigated in the last two decades since the first investigation looked at Arabidopsis thaliana. This body of knowledge and characterized sequences provide the basis for the identification, classification, and functional annotation of candidate sequences in new genome and transcriptome assemblies. A pipeline for the automatic identification and functional annotation of MYBs in a given sequence data set was implemented in Python. MYB candidates are identified, screened for the presence of a MYB domain and other motifs, and finally placed in a phylogenetic context with well characterized sequences. In addition to technical benchmarking based on existing annotation, the transcriptome assembly of Croton tiglium and the annotated genome sequence of Castanea crenata were screened for MYBs. Results of both analyses are presented in this study to illustrate the potential of this application. The analysis of one species takes only a few minutes depending on the number of predicted sequences and the size of the MYB gene family. This pipeline, the required bait sequences, and reference sequences for a classification are freely available on github: https://github.com/bpucker/MYB_annotator . This automatic annotation of the MYB gene family in novel assemblies makes genome-wide investigations consistent and paves the way for comparative studies in the future. Candidate genes for in-depth analyses are presented based on their orthology to previously characterized sequences which allows the functional annotation of the newly identified MYBs with high confidence.

Each method has its own pros and cons. The choice between them is a practical issue for plant systematists studying the evolutionary histories of biodiversity of relatively recent origins. However, few studies have compared the congruence and conflict between results from the two methods within the same group of organisms in plants. In this study, we employed RAD-seq and Hyb-Seq of Angiosperms353 genes in phylogenomic and biogeographic studies of Hamamelis (the witch-hazels) and Castanea (chestnuts), two classic examples exhibiting the well-known eastern Asian (EA) -eastern North American (ENA) disjunct distribution, and compared them side by side. Our results showed congruences in phylogenetic inference and divergence time dating between the two data sets obtained through our customized procedures of library preparation and sequence trimming, although they differed in the number of loci and informative sites, the amount of missing data, and sampling within species. We provide recommendations regarding the selection of the two methods for phylogenomic study at generic level based on fund availability and sampling scale. If funds and time are not constrained, we recommend Hyb-Seq. If funds and time are somewhat limited and sampling is large, we recommend RAD-seq. However, we found greater conflict among gene trees from the RAD-seq data due to the short sequences per locus. Therefore, species tree building and network detecting with the RAD-seq data with short RAD-seq loci (e.g., <150 bp) should avoid using analytical methods relying on gene trees of individual locus, but using site-based methods such as SVDQuartets and D-statistic method. Our phylogenetic analyses of RAD-seq and Hyb-Seq data resulted in well-resolved species relationships. Analyses of the data using the D-statistic test and PhyloNet revealed ancient introgressions in both genera. Biogeographic analyses including fossil data using total evidence-based dated tree and DEC model applying specific inter-area dispersal probabilities revealed a complicated history for each genus, indicating multiple interareal dispersals and local extinctions within and outside areas of the taxa's modern ranges in both the Paleogene and Neogene. The study demonstrates the importance of including fossil taxa for a more accurate reconstruction of biogeographic histories of taxa to understand the EA and ENA floristic disjunction. Our results support a widespread ancestral range in EA-western North America (WNA) followed by early diversification in EA and expansion to North America (NA) and Europe for Castanea and a more widespread ancestral range in EA-ENA-WNA for Hamamelis. The origins of the modern EA-ENA disjunction in both genera were suggested to be the result of vicariance from widespread ancestors in Eurasia-ENA of the mid-Miocene and in EA-NA of the late Oligocene, respectively.",chestnut,4.1,Q1,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution

Surveys were performed in northern Italy in 2019-2020. MD was carried out using the pheromone dispenser Ecodian® CT. The effectiveness of MD was assessed by recording male adult catches in pheromone-baited sticky traps and larvae in chestnut fruits, comparing MD and control plots. (3) Results: The total number of trapped males was significantly lower in MD plots than in control ones, for all sites and years. Trap catch suppression in MD plots averaged 89.5% and 93.8% for C. fagiglandana and 57.4% and 81% for C. splendana in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The larval infestation rate in fruits did not vary between plots except for one site where a reduction of about 71% in the MD plot was recorded in 2019. (4) Conclusions: Low catches in MD plots turned out to be a good measure of the effectiveness of communication disruption, but no satisfactory data have been obtained regarding fruit infestation, highlighting how the reduction of male catches cannot always be considered as a reliable indicator of successful control.

However, natural and human perturbations have nearly depleted its wild populations. The study identified the dominant environmental variables enabling and limiting its distribution and predicted its suitable habitats and distribution. The 212 occurrence records covering the whole distribution range of C. henryi in China and nine main bioclimatic variables were selected for detailed analysis. We applied the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) and QGIS to predict potentially suitable habitats under the current and four future climate-change scenarios. The limiting factors for distribution were accessed by Jackknife, percent contribution, and permutation importance. We found that the current distribution areas were concentrated in the typical subtropical zone, mainly Central and South China provinces. The modeling results indicated temperature as the critical determinant of distribution patterns, including mean temperature of the coldest quarter, isothermality, and mean diurnal range. Winter low temperature imposed an effective constraint on its spread. Moisture served as a secondary factor in species distribution, involving precipitation seasonality and annual precipitation. Under future climate-change scenarios, excellent habitats would expand and shift northwards, whereas range contraction would occur on the southern edge. Extreme climate change could bring notable range shrinkage. This study provided a basis for protecting the species' germplasm resources.

They are one of the 19 species of Araucaria family found around the world, with the nuts from South America being the most commonly consumed. They are traditionally eaten boiled or roasted. This study aims to profile the sensory properties of bunya nuts with chestnut as a comparator. Since chestnuts do not come from a conifer tree, it is expected that there will be differences. Different methods of preparation are also expected to change the sensory attributes. Representative samples were collected from a variety of locations in South-East Queensland, prepared and presented to a panel of 14 experienced tasters applying conventional sensory descriptive profiling. During training, the panel developed a lexicon of 23 sensory attributes together with definitions and reference. Profiles of the boiled and roasted bunya nuts revealed higher scores for hardness on the first bite than chestnuts and, when chewed, became more crumbly, dry, and grainy. They had a savory aroma and flavor, and roasted samples exhibited a roasted aroma. Bunya nut samples were less sweet than chestnut samples. Differences in the sensory properties due to method of preparation were also observed. Boiled bunya nuts were softer and moister, with lower scores for crumbly and grainy. This research is foundational in providing technical information on the sensory profile of this important Indigenous Australian nut and provides a strong basis to support novel food sector opportunities for the bunya nut as a reemerging food source not only in Australia, but also South America. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: There is an increase demand for local, sustainable, and natural foods. Bunya nuts are native to Australia and are part of the Araucaria family, which includes 19 species that can be found around the world. To the best of our knowledge there is no study characterizing Araucaria nuts in terms of sensory attributes. This study builds a lexicon for bunya nuts and compares to chestnuts. It also shows how different preparation methods affect its sensory attributes, as well as possible future uses in product development.

Lignin modification and concentration effects on the AL films were characterized by water vapor permeability (WVP), as well as morphological, mechanical, optical, thermal and active properties. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results showed that extracted L and LS had different structures, and the modification of L resulted in a peak shift and a decrease in peak intensities between 1250 and 800 cm-1 . The antioxidant and antimicrobial activity tests showed that films containing L had higher activity values (P < 0.05). WVP of the films containing ML was the lowest (P < 0.05) and the results revealed that 20% (w/w) concentration had an adverse effect on the WVP of films. The addition of L, LS and ML increased the tensile strength, elastic modulus and thermal properties (P < 0.05) compared to AL control films. With an increasing concentration, films containing L-based structures showed higher opacity and relatively lower L* values (P < 0.05). These results show that the addition of lignin to biopolymers is a promising method for improving the properties of biopolymers and providing functional attributes. LS had no or little effect on the film properties; however, the modification of L had the advantage of enhancing WVP and thermal properties at the same time as showing a decrease in functional properties compared to L. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",chestnut,2.2,Q1,Journal of insect science (Online)

Notable interactions included an increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when nicotinic acid is taken by patients using statins, an increased risk of bleeding associated with horse chestnut seed, especially when used in combination with warfarin, and reduced plasma concentration in many drugs when taken with zinc. Furthermore, N-acetylcysteine may interfere with concentrations of other medications used in the psychiatric setting, and polypodium leucotomos and turmeric may interfere with the CYP metabolic pathway, which may affect drugs metabolized by this pathway. Prior to recommending a treatment, dermatologists should foster awareness of these interactions. In order to advance the practice as a whole, research should continue to evaluate the drug interactions of these natural supplements.",chestnut,1.6,Q4,International ophthalmology

Their diverse bioactive constituents such as phytosterols, glucosinolates, carotenoids and polyphenols have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects. Tannins are the largest class of polyphenol compounds of plant extracts, which can be classified into two hydrolysable or condensed subgroups. Poultry and swine nutrition are the most important sectors in which tannins have been used, firstly adopting tannin-rich feedstuffs and more recently, using tannin extracts from different plants. Several commercial products are available containing tannins extracted from the European chestnut tree (Castanea sativa Mill.) and the American quebracho (Schinopsis spp.). Tannins extracted from these plants have been applied on intensive swine farms due to their ability to improve animal performance and health. These positive and prominent effects are frequently associated with the antinutritional effects in reducing feed palatability, digestibility and protein utilization of feed. Some criticisms and contrasting results regarding pig performance and intestinal health have been reported. This paper provides an overview of the effects of chestnut and quebracho tannins on growth performance and intestinal health of pigs in order to clarify the appropriate dosage and response in the various physiological stages.",chestnut,1.5,Q3,International Journal of Plant Sciences

Cell viability was determined by the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay (0-250 mg/mL) to select nontoxic concentrations, and DNA damage (0.1-10 μg/mL) was evaluated by the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis or comet assay. Treatment with honey samples or royal jelly and propolis did not affect the viability of HepG2 cells up to 100 and 50 mg/mL, respectively. Treatment with 100 μM BaP significantly increased (p ≤ 0.001) the levels of the DNA strand breaks. None of the tested concentrations (0.1-10 μg/mL) of the honey samples (thyme and chestnut), royal jelly, and propolis caused DNA damage per se. All tested samples at all the concentrations used decreased the genotoxic effect of BaP. In addition, all mixtures of thyme or chestnut honeys with royal jelly or propolis showed a greater protective effect against BaP than the samples alone, being the thyme and chestnut honey samples enriched with 10% royal jelly and 10% propolis the most effective (70.4% and 69.4%, respectively). The observed protective effect may be associated with the phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of the studied samples. In conclusion, the thyme and chestnut honey samples enriched with bee products present potential as natural chemoprotective agents against the chemical carcinogen BaP.",chestnut,1.5,Q3,International Journal of Plant Sciences

Phytoremediation is a low-cost green technology that uses metal-tolerant plants to extract these contaminants and rehabilitate the soil. In mine tailing restoration efforts, it can be beneficial to introduce species that can facilitate the colonization of other plants (i.e., nurse plant syndrome). In this study, the phytoremediation and nursing potential of two species adapted to metalliferous soil, Aloe burgersfortensis and A. castanea, were evaluated for the first time. An experiment was performed with aloe plants grown in pots containing potting soil, platinum tailings, and gold tailings. Leaves were assessed for bioaccumulation of PTMs. Seeds of Bermuda grass and African daisy, two successional pioneers, were planted with the aloes and had their developmental parameters evaluated after 30 days. Allelopathic effects were also assessed, with seeds of the pioneer plants infused with root extracts of the aloes from the different soil treatments. A. castanea demonstrated greater potential for the bioaccumulation of Cd, Co, Mn, Ni, and Zn in the tailings. The presence of aloes benefited germination rates, leaf count, length, and plant biomass of grasses and daisies in the mine tailings, without significant allelopathic effects. Therefore, aloes-especially A. castanea-should be employed in the rehabilitation of metal-contaminated soils to extract metals and to aid the establishment of other species to enhance the phytoremediation processes.",Castanea,1.5,Q3,International Journal of Plant Sciences

The term ""allergy to tree nuts"" includes allergies to almonds, Brazil nuts, cashew nuts, hazelnuts, chestnuts, macadamia nuts, pecan nuts, pistachios and walnuts. All tree nuts belong to five orders of plants: Rosaceae, Fagales, Sapindales, Ericales and Proteales. Allergies to tree nuts usually start in childhood, but unlike other food allergies, they rarely fade away and generally persist throughout life. They are one of the main causes of serious allergic reactions ending in death in both children and adults. The epidemiology of allergy to nuts is variable and depends mainly on the geographical zone and eating habits. In northern Europe, hazelnut allergy is prevalent, whereas in the USA the most common is allergy to peanuts and, when taking tree nuts into consideration, to walnuts. The diagnosis of allergies to nuts is difficult and requires the use of the most modern research tools including molecular diagnostic techniques.",chestnut,,,

The meta-analyses identified a nonsignificant increase in REE associated with nut consumption (weighted mean difference: 28.6 kcal/d; 95% CI: -10.7, 67.8 kcal/d). This study provided support for energy compensation as a potential mechanism for a lack of association between nut consumption and body weight, whereas no evidence was found for EE as an energy-regulating mechanism of nuts.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of high-pressure processing (HPP) and hydrothermal treatments (HT) on the physicochemical properties of rejected chestnut starch. Chestnuts were treated by HPP at 400, 500, and 600 MPa for 5 min and HT at 50 °C for 45 min. In general, all HPP treatments did not induce starch gelatinization, and their granules preserved the integrity and Maltese-cross. Moreover, starch granules' size and resistant starch content increased with the intensity of pressure. Native and HT chestnut starches were the most susceptible to digestion. HPP treatments did not affect the C-type crystalline pattern of native starch, but the crystalline region was gradually modified to become amorphous. HPP-600 MPa treated starch showed modified pasting properties and exhibited the highest values of peak viscosity. This study demonstrates for the first time that after HPP-600 MPa treatment, a novel chestnut starch gel structure is obtained. Moreover, HPP treatments could increase the slow-digesting starch, which benefits the development of healthier products. HPP can be considered an interesting technology to obtain added-value starch from rejected chestnut fruits.",chestnut,,,

Here, we evaluated the influence of phosphorylation and acetylation on the structural, physicochemical and functional properties of chestnut starch. Scanning electron micrographs showed the agglomeration of starch granules and the appearance of numerous dents on the starch granule surface under phosphorylation and acetylation. X-ray diffractograms confirmed that the modification treatments did not affect the C-type crystal pattern, but reduced the relative crystallinity of the chestnut starch, particularly phosphorylation. Moreover, modification improved the paste transparency of the starch. Differential scanning calorimeter analysis revealed that the gelatinization temperature and enthalpy of the starch decreased with the increasing substitution degree, particularly in phosphorylated starch. The Rapid Visco Analyser analysis demonstrated that phosphorylation could greatly improve the pasting properties of chestnut starch. In addition, phosphorylated and acetylated starch had a smaller amount of slowly digested starch and a larger amount of resistant starch relative to native chestnut starch. In conclusion, the functional and physicochemical properties of chestnut starch can be significantly improved through phosphorylation and acetylation, demonstrating its great application potential as a food additive.",chestnut,,,

However, they generally impart a dark colour to the tanned leather and highly contribute to the organic load in wastewaters. In this study, we employed a purification protocol separately on chestnut tannin (CT) and sulfited quebracho tannin (QT) to obtain the purified fractions (PCT and PQT). These samples were characterised by GPC, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR, and HPLC-DAD techniques and applied for tanning tests. Through the purification process, non-tannin components and smaller molecules such as gallic acid, glucopyranose, and catechin were effectively removed from CT and QT, which consequently led to the reduced moisture content, pH value, and lighter colour of purified fractions. The crust leathers processed with PCT and PQT showed desirable light shades. Moreover, the organic loads in PCT and PQT tanning wastewater were reduced by 13.5% and 19.1%, respectively, when compared to those in traditional CT and QT tanning wastewater. Additionally, the physical and mechanical characteristics of crust leathers processed with PCT and PQT were comparable to those processed with CT and QT. Thus, purification of vegetable tannins may serve as a feasible strategy for producing light-colored vegetable-tanned leather while minimizing organic pollutant discharge during the vegetable tanning process.

The antifungal mechanism of action of natamycin on N. parvum was investigated by conducting staining experiments of the fungal cell wall and cell membrane. Natamycin had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 100 μg/mL and a minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of 200 μg/mL against N. parvum. At five times the MFC, natamycin had a strong antifungal effect on chestnuts in vivo, and it effectively reduced morbidity and extended the storage period. The cell membrane was the primary target of natamycin action against N. parvum. Natamycin inhibits ergosterol synthesis, disrupts cell membranes, and causes intracellular protein, nucleic acid, and other macromolecule leakages. Furthermore, natamycin can cause oxidative damage to the fungus, as evidenced by decreased superoxide dismutase and catalase enzyme activity. Natamycin exerts a strong antifungal effect on the pathogenic fungus N. parvum from chestnuts, mainly through the disruption of fungal cell membranes.",chestnut,,,

The native range of P. shantungensis is China (Shaanxi, Shandong and Zhejiang provinces), but around 2010, the species entered the Republic of Korea and rapidly spread. Small and localised populations were also recently found in Türkiye (Marmara) and southern Russia (Krasnodyarskiy kray). Within the EU, a few individuals have been recorded in Italy (Pistoia province, Tuscany), in one locality in southern France (Alpes-Maritimes), in the Netherlands (Western Netherlands) and in one garden in Germany (Baden-Württemberg) where it was eradicated. P. shantungensis is not listed in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It is polyphagous, feeding on plants belonging to more than 200 species including many crop and ornamental plants. Economically important hosts in the EU include apple (M. domestica), citrus (Citrus spp.), walnut (Castanea sp.) and ornamentals such as hibiscus (Hibiscus spp.) and camellia (Camellia japonica), as well as forest trees, mostly deciduous. In the Republic of Korea, the species has one generation per year. It overwinters as eggs and goes through five nymphal instars. Its impact is due to oviposition obstructing the vascular system of its hosts, depletion of the host resources and egestion of honeydew promoting the development of sooty moulds. Plants for planting constitute the main pathway for entry into the EU and for spread. Climatic conditions in southern EU countries and host plant availability in those areas would allow establishment and spread. The introduction of P. shantungensis is expected to have an economic impact in the EU through the reduction in yield, quality and commercial value of fruits and ornamental plants. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of entry and further spread. P. shantungensis meets the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.",Castanea,,,

Although many works have separately addressed the impacts on chestnut of elevated temperatures and Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands (Pc) infection, none have studied their combined effect. The objectives of this work were to describe the physiology, secondary metabolism and survival of 6-month-old C. sativa seedlings after plants were exposed to ambient temperature, high ambient temperature and heat wave events, and subsequent infection by Pc. Ten days after the warming scenarios, the biochemistry of plant leaves and roots was quantified and the recovery effect assessed. Plant growth and root biomass under high ambient temperature were significantly higher than in plants under ambient temperature and heat wave event. Seven secondary metabolite compounds in leaves and three in roots were altered significantly with temperature. Phenolic compounds typically decreased in response to increased temperature, whereas ellagic acid in roots was significantly more abundant in plants exposed to ambient and high ambient temperature than in plants subjected to heat waves. At recovery, leaf procyanidin and catechin remained downregulated in plants exposed to high ambient temperature. Mortality by Pc was fastest and highest in plants exposed to ambient temperature and lowest in plants under high ambient temperature. Changes in the secondary metabolite profile of plants in response to Pc were dependent on the warming scenarios plants were exposed to, with five compounds in leaves and three in roots showing a significant 'warming scenario' × 'Pc' interaction. The group of trees that best survived Pc infection was characterised by increased quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, 3-feruloylquinic acid, gallic acid ethyl ester and ellagic acid. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study addressing the combined effects of global warming and Pc infection in chestnut.",Castanea,,,

In this study, the Chinese chestnut 'Huaihuang' was used to explore the possible mechanisms of ovule abortion with respect to morphology and proteomics. The morphology and microstructure of abortive ovules were found to be considerably different from those of fertile ovules at 20 days after anthesis (20 DAA). The fertile ovules had completely formed tissues, such as the embryo sac, embryo and endosperm. By contrast, in the abortive ovules, there were no embryo sacs, and wide spaces between the integuments were observed, with few nucelli. Fluorescence labelling of the nuclei and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations showed that cells of abortive ovules were abnormally shaped and had thickened cell walls, folded cell membranes, condensed cytoplasm, ruptured nuclear membranes, degraded nucleoli and reduced mitochondria. The iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation) results showed that in the abortive ovules, low levels of soluble protein with small molecular weights were found, and most of differently expressed proteins (DEPs) were related to protein synthesis, accumulation of active oxygen free radical, energy synthesis and so on. These DEPs might be associated with abnormal ovules formation.",Castanea,,,

A total of 258 Ross 308 chicks were divided into six dietary regimens, including: a basal diet without additives as a first control group (CON); the second group received a basal diet supplemented with 200 g/t in the starter phase and 100 g/t in the grower and finisher phase; the third group-400 g/t and 200 g/t; the fourth group-600 g/t and 300 g/t; the fifth group-800 g/t and 400 g/t; and the sixth group-1000 g/t and 500 g/t of a complex phytobiotic supplement based on tannins, respectively. The CPFA contains the following: tannins 36.8-55.2%, eugenol 0.4-0.6%, cinnamon aldehyde 0.8-1.2%, zinc-methionine 1.6-2.4%, calcium butyrate 8-12%, silicon dioxide 1.2-1.8% and dextrose up to 100%. The maximum introduction of phytobiotics (1000 g/t) at 7 days of age leads to a decrease in the live weight of broilers which reduced by 8.27% (p < 0.05) compared to the minimum level of phytobiotics (200 g/t). From 15-21 days, the live weight was significant between the supplemented and control groups and represented 396.21, 384.81 and 384.16 vs. 316.91 g for the CPFA 4, CPFA 5, CPFA 1 and control group, respectively. Furthermore, the same trend was recorded in the average daily gain during the periods between 15-21 and 22-28 days of the experiment. Feeding CPFA had a positive effect on the carcass indicators, except for the feeding of CPFA 3 in the amount of 600 g/t in the starter phase and 300 g/t in the grower and finish phases, which recorded the lowest weight in relation to the CPFA 1 and 2 groups and represented 1309.58 vs. 1460.06 and 1456.52 g, respectively, and the difference was significant. The inclusion of CPFA in poultry diets contributed to an increase in lung mass in the experimental groups relative to the control group, except for the CPFA 5 group which represented the lowest weight of lung mass (6.51 g) and the differences were significant between the CPFA 2 and CPFA 3 and the control groups. The highest concentration of leukocytes was observed during the experiment period in the group of poultry receiving phytobiotics (CPFA 3), which significantly exceeded the control group by 2.37 × 109/L. A significant decrease in the level of cholesterol was recorded in the CPFA groups when compared to the control group and represented 2.83 vs. 3.55 mmol/L, respectively. Consequently, the introduction of vegetable feed additives from complex phytobiotic feed additives (CPFA) in the diets of Ross 308 chicks had a positive effect on the growth production, the carcass yield, the mass of the pectoral muscles and the mass of the lungs.

P. apicalis is a polyphagous pest native to New Zealand. The majority of its life cycle is spent inside tree wood, but it does not directly feed on plant tissue, instead larvae and adults feed on a symbiotic fungus (Sporothrix nothofagi which is pathogenic to Nothofagus spp.) vectored by adults and introduced when they bore tunnels into the host. P. apicalis feeds within a wide range of live, often stressed trees, in dead or dying hardwood and softwood trees, and fallen or felled trees. Successful reproduction can occur inside a number of living tree species including Castanea sativa, Pinus spp. and Ulmus spp. P. apicalis is not known to have established outside of New Zealand although findings have been reported in Australia. Whilst there are no records of interceptions of this species in the EU, platypodines are intercepted with solid wood packing material (SWPM) and Platypus species, but not P. apicalis, have been intercepted with wooden logs in Japan. Host plants for planting also provide a potential pathway. Hosts are grown widely across the EU in areas with climates comparable to those in New Zealand where the pest occurs suggesting that conditions in the EU are suitable for its establishment. If introduced into the EU, adults could disperse naturally by flight, perhaps tens or hundreds of metres. The movement of infested wood and host plants for planting within the EU could facilitate spread. Economic impacts in forestry and timber industries would result from the galleries created by P. apicalis and from wood staining caused by the symbiotic fungus. Phytosanitary measures are available to inhibit the entry of P. apicalis. P. apicalis satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.",Castanea,,,

Currently, there is limited information about non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) genes that respond to abiotic stress in chestnuts. Here, a chestnut nsLTP, named CmnsLTP6.9, was identified and analyzed. The results showed that the CmnsLTP6.9 protein localized in the extracellular matrix had two splicing variants (CmnsLTP6.9L and CmnsLTP6.9S). Compared with CmnsLTP6.9L, CmnsLTP6.9S had an 87 bp deletion in the 5'-terminal. Overexpression of CmnsLTP6.9L in Arabidopsis enhanced tolerance to osmotic and drought stress. Upon exposure to osmotic and drought treatment, CmnsLTP6.9L could increase reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzyme activity, alleviating ROS damage. However, CmnsLTP6.9S-overexpressing lines showed no significant differences in phenotype, ROS content, and related enzyme activities compared with the wild type (WT) under osmotic and drought treatment. Moreover, lipid metabolism analysis confirmed that, unlike CmnsLTP6.9S, CmnsLTP6.9L mainly altered and upregulated many fatty acyls and glycerophospholipids, which implied that CmnsLTP6.9L and CmnsLTP6.9S played different roles in lipid transference in the chestnut. Taken together, we analyzed the functions of CmnsLTP6.9L and CmnsLTP6.9S, and demonstrated that CmnsLTP6.9L enhanced drought and osmotic stress tolerance through ROS scavenging and lipid metabolism.",Castanea,,,

The reduced yield of Castanea sativa Mill can be attributed to two main species: Phytophthora cinnamomi and Phytophthora cambivora, with the first being the main pathogen responsible for ink disease in Portugal. P. cinnamomi is a highly aggressive and widely distributed plant pathogen, capable of infecting nearly 1000 host species. This oomycete causes substantial economic losses and is accountable for the decline of numerous plant species in Europe and worldwide. To date, no effective treatments are available to combat these pathogens. Given chestnut's economic and ecological significance, particularly in Portugal, it is crucial to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between Phytophthora species and host plants. This can be achieved through the study of the glucanase inhibitor protein (GIP) produced by P. cinnamomi during infection. The technique of RNA interference (RNAi) was employed to suppress the GIP gene of P. cinnamomi. The resulting transformants, carrying the silenced gene, were used to infect C. sativa, allowing for the assessment of the effects of gene silencing on the plant's phenotype. Additionally, bioinformatics tools predicted the secretion of GIP protein. The obtained results validate RNAi as a potential alternative tool for studying molecular factors and for controlling and managing P. cinnamomi.",Castanea,,,

After the intragastric administration of CPA (200 or 400 mg/kg/day), the colon length and body weights of mice with colitis increased and the disease activity index reduced. CPA alleviated colon tissue damage by elevating ZO-1 and occludin protein levels and regulating TNF-α and IL-1β by inhibiting the protein expression of NLPR3 and NF-κB p65. The abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes was altered and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels, especially propionic, butyric, and isovaleric acids increased significantly. These results indicated that CPA could alleviate colitis by protecting mucosal barriers, reducing inflammation, and regulating intestinal microbiota and SCFA levels.

With the aim to give an interesting opportunity to use chestnuts by-products for the development of nutraceutical and/or cosmetic formulations, the investigation of burs and leaves along with chestnuts of C. sativa, cultivar ""Marrone di Roccadaspide"", has been performed. The phenolic, tannin, and flavonoid content of the MeOH extracts of ""Marrone di Roccadaspide"" burs, leaves, and chestnuts as well as their antioxidant activity by spectrophotometric methods (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC), and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) have been evaluated. Furthermore, a cell-based antioxidant in vitro test along with in vitro assays for the evaluation of the ability to reduce nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation and nitric oxide (NO) production have been carried out. In order to identify the secondary metabolites responsible for the high phenolic content and the strong antioxidant activity shown by leaves and burs extracts, and to highlight the differences between their chemical composition, the analysis of the metabolite profile of the MeOH extracts obtained from both by-products and chestnuts by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization and multiple-stage linear ion-trap and Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-(-)ESI/LTQOrbitrap/MS/MS) has been performed. LC-MS analysis allowed the identification of different classes of specialized metabolites including hydrolyzable tannins, flavonoids, ellagic acid and phenol glucoside derivatives, and triterpenoids as well as polar lipids. Our results show how the antioxidant activity of the extracts can be correlated to their high tannins and flavonoids content while polar lipids occurring in the MeOH extract of the leaves could contribute to determining its higher anti-inflammatory activity.",Castanea,,,

The coefficient of variation values of the 16 morphological traits of the test materials ranged from 11.11% to 60.38%. A total of 58 alleles were detected using six pairs of SSR core primers, with an average number of 9.7 alleles per locus. The average number of valid alleles per locus was 3.9419 and the proportion of valid alleles was 40.78%. A total of 105 genotypes were detected, and the number of genotypic species that could be amplified per primer pair ranged from 8 to 26. The mean value of the observed heterozygosity was 0.4986. The variation in the He, H, and PIC values was similar; the size of I value was approximately 2.21 times larger, and its mean number of variations was 0.7390, 0.7359, 0.6985, and 1.6015, respectively. The classification of 118 Castanea species was performed using three analytical methods: structure analysis, neighbor-joining (NJ) cluster analysis, and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), and the results of the three methods were in high agreement. Six pairs of SSR core primers with high polymorphism and strong discriminatory properties were used to identify 118 Castanea plants, and a unique molecular ID card was constructed for each material. These results provide insight into the genetic diversity and population structure of Castanea plants and a theoretical basis for improving the phenomenon of mixed varieties and substandard plants in the Castanea plant market.",Castanea,,,

The genus Lepiota is supposed to include a high number of species producing amatoxins. In this study, we investigated 16 species of Lepiota based on 48 recently collected specimens for the presence of amatoxins by liquid chromatography coupled to a diode-array detector and mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS). By comparing the retention times, UV absorptions, and diagnostic MS fragment ions with data obtained from the benchmark species Amanita phalloides, we detected α-amanitin and γ-amanitin in Lepiota subincarnata, α-amanitin and amaninamide in Lepiota brunneoincarnata, and β-amanitin and α-amanitin in Lepiota elaiophylla. Phallotoxins have not been detected any of these species. Two possibly undescribed amatoxin derivatives were found in Lepiota boudieri and L. elaiophylla, as well as one further non-amatoxin compound in one specimen of L. cf. boudieri. These compounds might be used to differentiate L. elaiophylla from L. xanthophylla and species within the L. boudieri species complex. No amatoxins were detected in L. aspera, L. castanea, L. clypeolaria, L. cristata, L. erminea, L. felina, L. fuscovinacea, L. lilacea, L. magnispora, L. oreadiformis, L. pseudolilacea, L. sp. (SeSa 5), and L. subalba. By combining the occurrence data of amatoxins with a phylogenetic analysis, a monophyletic group of amatoxin containing species of Lepiota is evident. These chemotaxonomic results highlight the relevance of systematic relationships for the occurrence of amatoxins and expand our knowledge about the toxicity of species of Lepiota.",Castanea,,,

Obesity triggers high levels of circulating FFAs, which can cause intramuscular lipid (IMCL) deposition. Diverse phytochemicals, including crude Castanea crenata inner shell extract (CCE), have been shown to possess an anti-obesity effect. We aimed to demonstrate whether the aqueous fraction of CCE (ACCE) provides an anti-obesity effect with a decrease in plasma FFAs and reduces IMCL. High-fat-fed C57BL/6 mice received ACCE via water intake. A204 cells incubated with fatty acids were treated with ACCE. Lipid accumulation and mitochondrial metabolism were assessed using histological and molecular techniques. ACCE possessed a notably higher gallic acid content than CCE among the constituents. ACCE-administered mice exhibited reduced plasma FFA levels, adiposity, and IMCL. Muscle lipotoxicity was suppressed, including apoptosis, ER stress, and inflammation. The anti-lipid effect of ACCE was observed with the induction of mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation in muscle. ACCE increases mitochondrial respiration and FAO in skeletal muscle and protects muscle from IMCL and lipotoxicity, reducing plasma FFA and adiposity.",Castanea,,,

Although the morphology of the teleomorphs of the majority of Chaetosphaeria is rather uniform, their associated anamorphs primarily exhibit the variability and evolutionary change observed in the genus. An exception from the morphological monotony among Chaetosphaeria species is a group characterised by scolecosporous, hyaline to light pink, multiseptate, asymmetrical ascospores and a unique three-layered ascomatal wall. Paragaeumannomyces sphaerocellularis, the type species of the genus, exhibits these morphological traits and is compared with similar Chaetosphaeria with craspedodidymum- and chloridium-like synanamorphs. Morphological comparison and phylogenetic analyses of the combined ITS-28S sequences of 35 isolates and vouchers with these characteristics revealed a strongly-supported, morphologically well-delimited clade in the Chaetosphaeriaceae containing 16 species. The generic name Paragaeumannomyces is applied to this monophyletic clade; eight new combinations and five new species, i.e. P. abietinus sp. nov., P. elegans sp. nov., P. granulatus sp. nov., P. sabinianus sp. nov. and P. smokiensis sp. nov., are proposed. A key to Paragaeumannomyces is provided. Using morphology, cultivation studies and phylogenetic analyses of ITS and 28S rDNA, two additional new species from freshwater and terrestrial habitats, Codinaea paniculata sp. nov. and Striatosphaeria castanea sp. nov., are described in the family. A codinaea-like anamorph of S. castanea forms conidia with setulae at each end in axenic culture; this feature expands the known morphology of Striatosphaeria. A chaetosphaeria-like teleomorph is experimentally linked to Dendrophoma cytisporoides, a sporodochial hyphomycete and type species of Dendrophoma, for the first time.",Castanea,未知,未知,Mycology

(Fagaceae) is a deciduous tree grown for its wood and edible fruits. Chestnut processing produces residues (burs, shells, and leaves) exploitable for their diversity in bioactive compounds in animal nutrition. In fact, plant-specialized metabolites likely act as rumen modifiers. Thus, the recovery of residual plant parts as feed ingredients is an evaluable strategy. In this context, European chestnut leaves from northern Germany have been investigated, proving to be a good source of flavonoids as well as gallo- and ellagitannins. To this purpose, an alcoholic extract was obtained and an untargeted profiling carried out, mainly by means of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HR MS/MS) techniques. To better unravel the polyphenol constituents, fractionation strategies were employed to obtain a lipophilic fraction and a polar one. This latter was highly responsive to total phenolic and flavonoid content analyses, as well as to antiradical (DPPH● and ABTS+●) and reducing activity (PFRAP) assays. The effect of the alcoholic extract and its fractions on rumen liquor was also evaluated in vitro in terms of fermentative parameter changes and impact on methanogenesis. The data acquired confirm that chestnut leaf extract and the fractions therefrom promote an increase in total volatile fatty acids, while decreasing acetate/propionate ratio and CH4 production.",Castanea,,,
