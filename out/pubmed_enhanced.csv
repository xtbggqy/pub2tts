Here we present data from the first phase of the Chinese Pangenome Consortium, including a collection of 116 high-quality and haplotype-phased de novo assemblies based on 58 core samples representing 36 minority Chinese ethnic groups. With an average 30.65× high-fidelity long-read sequence coverage, an average contiguity N50 of more than 35.63 megabases and an average total size of 3.01 gigabases, the CPC core assemblies add 189 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,367 protein-coding gene duplications to GRCh38. We identified 15.9 million small variants and 78,072 structural variants, of which 5.9 million small variants and 34,223 structural variants were not reported in a recently released pangenome reference1. The Chinese Pangenome Consortium data demonstrate a remarkable increase in the discovery of novel and missing sequences when individuals are included from underrepresented minority ethnic groups. The missing reference sequences were enriched with archaic-derived alleles and genes that confer essential functions related to keratinization, response to ultraviolet radiation, DNA repair, immunological responses and lifespan, implying great potential for shedding new light on human evolution and recovering missing heritability in complex disease mapping.",64.8,未知,Nature

Yet when comparing a sample to a pangenome, variants in the pangenome that are not part of the sample can be misleading, for example, causing false read mappings. These irrelevant variants are generally rarer in terms of allele frequency, and have previously been dealt with by filtering rare variants. However, this blunt heuristic both fails to remove some irrelevant variants and removes many relevant variants. We propose a new approach that imputes a personalized pangenome subgraph by sampling local haplotypes according to k-mer counts in the reads. We implement the approach in the vg toolkit ( https://github.com/vgteam/vg ) for the Giraffe short-read aligner and compare its accuracy to state-of-the-art methods using human pangenome graphs from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium.

Poplars, among the world's most widely distributed and cultivated trees, exhibit extensive phenotypic diversity and environmental adaptability. In this study, we present a genus-level super-pangenome comprising 19 Populus genomes, revealing the likely pivotal role of private genes in facilitating local environmental and climate adaptation. Through the integration of pangenomes with transcriptomes, methylomes, and chromatin accessibility mapping, we unveil that the evolutionary trajectories of pangenes and duplicated genes are closely linked to local genomic landscapes of regulatory and epigenetic architectures, notably CG methylation in gene-body regions. Further comparative genomic analyses have enabled the identification of 142 202 structural variants across species that intersect with a significant number of genes and contribute substantially to both phenotypic and adaptive divergence. We have experimentally validated a ∼180-bp presence/absence variant affecting the expression of the CUC2 gene, crucial for leaf serration formation.

New sequencing technologies enable researchers to produce multiple high-quality genome sequences and catalog diverse genetic variations with better precision. Pangenomic studies have detected structural variants in plant genomes, dissected the genetic architecture of agronomic traits, and helped unravel molecular underpinnings and evolutionary origins of plant phenotypes. The pangenome concept has further evolved into a so-called superpangenome that includes wild relatives within a genus or clade and shifted to graph-based reference systems. Nevertheless, building pangenomes and representing complex structural variants remain challenging in many crops. Standardized computing pipelines and common data structures are needed to compare and interpret pangenomes.

Here, we argue that this diversity of gene pools carried by different strains is maintained largely due to the control exercised by viral predation. Viruses maintain a high strain diversity through time that we describe as constant-diversity equilibrium, preventing the hoarding of resources by specific clones. Thus, viruses facilitate the release and degradation of dissolved organic matter in the ocean, which may lead to better ecosystem functioning by linking top-down to bottom-up control. By maintaining this equilibrium, viruses act as a key element of the adaptation of marine microbes to their environment and likely behave as a single evolutionary unit.",11.1,未知,Annual Review of Genetics

Some species have fluid pangenomes, with a high proportion of genes varying between individual genomes. Other species have less fluid pangenomes, with different genomes tending to contain the same genes. Two main hypotheses have been suggested to explain this variation: differences in species' bacterial lifestyle and effective population size. However, previous studies have not been able to test between these hypotheses because the different features of lifestyle and effective population size are highly correlated with each other, and phylogenetically conserved, making it hard to disentangle their relative importance. We used phylogeny-based analyses, across 126 bacterial species, to tease apart the causal role of different factors. We found that pangenome fluidity was lower in i) host-associated compared with free-living species and ii) host-associated species that are obligately dependent on a host, live inside cells, and are more pathogenic and less motile. In contrast, we found no support for the competing hypothesis that larger effective population sizes lead to more fluid pangenomes. Effective population size appears to correlate with pangenome variation because it is also driven by bacterial lifestyle, rather than because of a causal relationship.",11.1,未知,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

One approach is to call and phase single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on a reference sequence. However, this approach becomes unstable on large segmental duplications (SDs) or structural variations (SVs) because the alignments of reads deriving from these regions tend to be unreliable. Another approach is to use highly accurate PacBio HiFi reads to output diploid assembly directly. Nonetheless, HiFi reads cannot phase homozygous regions longer than their length and require oxford nanopore technology (ONT) reads or Hi-C to produce a fully phased assembly. Is a single long-read sequencing technology sufficient to create an accurate diploid assembly? Here, we present JTK, a megabase-scale diploid genome assembler. It first randomly samples kilobase-scale sequences (called 'chunks') from the long reads, phases variants found on them, and produces two haplotypes. The novel idea of JTK is to utilize chunks to capture SNVs and SVs simultaneously. From 60-fold ONT reads on the HG002 and a Japanese sample, it fully assembled two haplotypes with approximately 99.9% accuracy on the histocompatibility complex (MHC) and the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) regions, which was impossible by the reference-based approach. In addition, in the LRC region on a Japanese sample, JTK output an assembly of better contiguity than those built from high-coverage HiFi+Hi-C. In the coming age of pan-genomics, JTK would complement the reference-based phasing method to assemble the difficult-to-assemble but medically important regions.

Pangenome analysis predominantly leverages graph-based methods that require computationally intensive multiple genome alignments, do not scale to highly complex eukaryotic genomes, limit their scope to identifying structural variants (SVs), or incur bias by relying on a reference genome. Here, we present PanKmer, a toolkit designed for reference-free analysis of pangenome datasets consisting of dozens to thousands of individual genomes. PanKmer decomposes a set of input genomes into a table of observed k-mers and their presence-absence values in each genome. These are stored in an efficient k-mer index data format that encodes SNPs, INDELs, and SVs. It also includes functions for downstream analysis of the k-mer index, such as calculating sequence similarity statistics between individuals at whole-genome or local scales. For example, k-mers can be ""anchored"" in any individual genome to quantify sequence variability or conservation at a specific locus. This facilitates workflows with various biological applications, e.g. identifying cases of hybridization between plant species. PanKmer provides researchers with a valuable and convenient means to explore the full scope of genetic variation in a population, without reference bias. PanKmer is implemented as a Python package with components written in Rust, released under a BSD license. The source code is available from the Python Package Index (PyPI) at https://pypi.org/project/pankmer/ as well as Gitlab at https://gitlab.com/salk-tm/pankmer.

Because they introduce less biases, pangenomes, represented as graphs, tend to supplant the usual linear representation of a reference genome, augmented with variations. However, this major change requires new tools adapted to this data structure. Among the numerous questions that can be addressed to a pangenome graph is the search for conserved or divergent genes. In this article, we present a new tool, named PanSel, which computes a conservation score for each segment of the genome, and finds genomic regions that are significantly conserved, or divergent.

However, current methods for studying sequence composition and conservation within pangenomes have limitations. Methods based on graph pangenomes require a computationally expensive multiple-alignment step, which can leave out some variation. Indexes based on k-mers and de Bruijn graphs are limited to answering questions at a specific substring length k. We present Maximal Exact Match Ordered (MEMO), a pangenome indexing method based on maximal exact matches (MEMs) between sequences. A single MEMO index can handle arbitrary-length queries over pangenomic windows. MEMO enables both queries that test k-mer presence/absence (membership queries) and that count the number of genomes containing k-mers in a window (conservation queries). MEMO's index for a pangenome of 89 human autosomal haplotypes fits in 2.04 GB, 8.8 × smaller than a comparable KMC3 index and 11.4 × smaller than a PanKmer index. MEMO indexes can be made smaller by sacrificing some counting resolution, with our decile-resolution HPRC index reaching 0.67 GB. MEMO can conduct a conservation query for 31-mers over the human leukocyte antigen locus in 13.89 s, 2.5 × faster than other approaches. MEMO's small index size, lack of k-mer length dependence, and efficient queries make it a flexible tool for studying and visualizing substring conservation in pangenomes.",5.6,未知,Journal of Molecular Biology

Here, we developed a new solution using nanopore sequencing of viral pangenomes amplified by PCR. Benchmark tests using HIV-1 molecular clones demonstrated an accuracy of up to 99.9%. In addition, validation tests of our protocol in 106 clinical samples demonstrated high concordance of drug resistance and tropism genotypes (92.5% and 98.1%, respectively) between the nanopore sequencing-based results and archived clinical determinations made based on Sanger sequencing data.

However, any reference genome contains only a fraction of the microbial pangenome, the total set of genes observed in a given species. Reference-based approaches are thus blind to the dynamics of the accessory genome, as well as variation within gene order and copy number. With the widespread usage of long-read sequencing, the number of high-quality, complete genome assemblies has increased dramatically. In addition to pangenomic approaches that focus on the variation in the sets of genes present in different genomes, complete assemblies allow investigations of the evolution of genome structure and gene order. This latter problem, however, is computationally demanding with few tools available that shed light on these dynamics. Here, we present PanGraph, a Julia-based library and command line interface for aligning whole genomes into a graph. Each genome is represented as a path along vertices, which in turn encapsulate homologous multiple sequence alignments.

Our objective was to evaluate the site-specialization of Gemella species among various habitats within the mouth by combining pangenomics and metagenomics. With pangenomics, we identified genome relationships and categorized genes as core and accessory to each species. With metagenomics, we identified the primary oral habitat of individual genomes. Our results establish that the genomes of three species, G. haemolysans, G. sanguinis and G. morbillorum, are abundant and prevalent in human mouths at different oral sites: G. haemolysans on buccal mucosa and keratinized gingiva; G. sanguinis on tongue dorsum, throat, and tonsils; and G. morbillorum in dental plaque. The gene-level basis of site-specificity was investigated by identifying genes that were core to Gemella genomes at a specific oral site but absent from other Gemella genomes. The riboflavin biosynthesis pathway was present in G. haemolysans genomes associated with buccal mucosa but absent from the rest of the genomes. Overall, metapangenomics show that Gemella species have clear ecological preferences in the oral cavity of healthy humans and provides an approach to identifying gene-level drivers of site specificity.",2.0,未知,Journal of theoretical biology

These irrelevant variants are generally rarer in terms of allele frequency, and have previously been dealt with using allele frequency filters. However, this is a blunt heuristic that both fails to remove some irrelevant variants and removes many relevant variants. We propose a new approach, inspired by local ancestry inference methods, that imputes a personalized pangenome subgraph based on sampling local haplotypes according to k-mer counts in the reads. Our approach is tailored for the Giraffe short read aligner, as the indexes it needs for read mapping can be built quickly. We compare the accuracy of our approach to state-of-the-art methods using graphs from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium. The resulting personalized pangenome pipelines provide faster pangenome read mapping than comparable pipelines that use a linear reference, reduce small variant genotyping errors by 4x relative to the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best-practice pipeline, and for the first time make short-read structural variant genotyping competitive with long-read discovery methods.",未知,未知,bioRxiv: The Preprint Server for Biology
