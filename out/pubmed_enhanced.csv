Starting from simple sugars, three groups of polysaccharides, namely, cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectins, with very different physical properties are assembled by the cell to make a strong yet extensible wall. This Review describes the physics of wall growth and its regulation by cellular processes such as cellulose production by cellulose synthase, modulation of wall pH by plasma membrane H+-ATPase, wall loosening by expansin and signalling by plant hormones such as auxin and brassinosteroid. In addition, this Review discusses the nuanced roles, properties and interactions of cellulose, matrix polysaccharides and cell wall proteins and describes how wall stress and wall loosening cooperatively result in cell wall growth.",plant,88.1,Q1,Nature Reviews Microbiology

In this Review, we discuss recent developments of various CRISPR-based systems that can transiently or permanently modify the genome and the transcriptome. The discovery of further CRISPR enzymes and systems through functional metagenomics has meaningfully broadened the applicability of CRISPR-based editing. Engineered Cas variants offer diverse capabilities such as base editing, prime editing, gene insertion and gene regulation, thereby providing a panoply of tools for the scientific community. We highlight the strengths and weaknesses of current CRISPR tools, considering their efficiency, precision, specificity, reliance on cellular DNA repair mechanisms and their applications in both fundamental biology and therapeutics.

This Review provides a perspective on the role of TEs in cancer as being a 'double-edged sword', both promoting cancer evolution and representing a vulnerability that could be exploited in cancer therapy.

However, their boundaries are not well defined, and how these basic units arise remains elusive. In rice with clear nodes and internodes, we found that one subclade of class I knotted1-like homeobox (KNOX1) genes for shoot meristem indeterminacy restricts node differentiation and allows internode formation by repressing YABBY genes for leaf development and genes from another node-specific KNOX1 subclade. YABBYs promote nodal vascular differentiation and limit stem elongation. YABBY and node-specific KNOX1 genes specify the pulvinus, which further elaborates the nodal structure for gravitropism. Notably, this KNOX1 subclade organization is specific to seed plants. We propose that nodes and internodes are distinct domains specified by YABBY-KNOX1 cross-regulation that diverged in early seed plants.",plant,56.9,Q1,"Science (New York, N.Y.)"

These irrelevant variants are generally rarer in terms of allele frequency, and have previously been dealt with by filtering rare variants. However, this blunt heuristic both fails to remove some irrelevant variants and removes many relevant variants. We propose a new approach that imputes a personalized pangenome subgraph by sampling local haplotypes according to k-mer counts in the reads.

For the longest time, vein formation was thought to be controlled only by the polar, cell-to-cell transport of the plant hormone auxin; recent evidence suggests that is not so. Instead, it turns out that vein patterning features are best accounted for by a combination of polar auxin transport, facilitated auxin diffusion through plasmodesma intercellular channels, and auxin signal transduction-though the latter's precise contribution remains unclear. Equally unclear remain the sites of auxin production during leaf development, on which that vein patterning mechanism ought to depend.

The number of COGs has been expanded from 4877 to 4981, primarily by including protein families involved in bacterial protein secretion. Accordingly, COG pathways and functional groups now include secretion systems of types II through X, as well as Flp/Tad and type IV pili. These groupings allow straightforward identification and examination of the prokaryotic lineages that encompass-or lack-a particular secretion system. Other developments include improved annotations for the rRNA and tRNA modification proteins, multi-domain signal transduction proteins, and some previously uncharacterized protein families. The new version of COGs is available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/COG, as well as on the NCBI FTP site https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/COG/, which also provides archived data from previous COG releases.",genome,14.9,Q1,Nucleic acids research

This is frustrating for researchers working in the field and confusing for researchers new to the field.

Yet for many years, the human genome reference sequence remained incomplete and lacked representation of human genetic diversity. Recently, two major advances have emerged to address these shortcomings: complete gap-free human genome sequences, such as the one developed by the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium, and high-quality pangenomes, such as the one developed by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium. Facilitated by advances in long-read DNA sequencing and genome assembly algorithms, complete human genome sequences resolve regions that have been historically difficult to sequence, including centromeres, telomeres, and segmental duplications.

TIR modules are activated by self-association and in plants, mammals and bacteria, some TIRs have enzymatic functions that are crucial for disease resistance and/or cell death. Many plant TIR-only proteins and pathogen effector-activated TIR-domain NLR receptors are NAD+ hydrolysing enzymes. Biochemical, structural and functional studies established that for both plant TIR-protein types, and certain bacterial TIRs, NADase activity generates bioactive signalling intermediates which promote resistance. A set of plant TIR-catalysed nucleotide isomers was discovered which bind to and activate EDS1 complexes, promoting their interactions with co-functioning helper NLRs.

In angiosperms, two plant hormones, salicylic Acid (SA) and Jasmonates (JAs), play a key role in plant defense, where JAs-mediated defenses are typically activated in response to herbivores and necrotrophic pathogens, whereas SA is prioritized against hemi/biotrophic pathogens. Thus, studying the evolution of SA and JAs and their crosstalk is essential to understand the evolution of molecular plant-microbe interactions (EvoMPMI) in land plants. Recent advances in the evolution of SA and JAs biosynthesis, signaling, and crosstalk in land plants illustrated that the insight gained in angiosperms does not necessarily apply to non-seed plant lineages, where the receptors perceive different ligands and the hormones activate pathways independently on the canonical receptors. In this review, recent findings on the two main defense hormones (JAs and SA) in non-seed plants, including functional studies in the bryophyte model Marchantia polymorpha, will be discussed.",plant,8.3,Q1,Current Opinion in Plant Biology

Pangenome analysis predominantly leverages graph-based methods that require computationally intensive multiple genome alignments, do not scale to highly complex eukaryotic genomes, limit their scope to identifying structural variants (SVs), or incur bias by relying on a reference genome. Here, we present PanKmer, a toolkit designed for reference-free analysis of pangenome datasets consisting of dozens to thousands of individual genomes. PanKmer decomposes a set of input genomes into a table of observed k-mers and their presence-absence values in each genome. These are stored in an efficient k-mer index data format that encodes SNPs, INDELs, and SVs. It also includes functions for downstream analysis of the k-mer index, such as calculating sequence similarity statistics between individuals at whole-genome or local scales. For example, k-mers can be ""anchored"" in any individual genome to quantify sequence variability or conservation at a specific locus. This facilitates workflows with various biological applications, e.g. identifying cases of hybridization between plant species. PanKmer provides researchers with a valuable and convenient means to explore the full scope of genetic variation in a population, without reference bias. PanKmer is implemented as a Python package with components written in Rust, released under a BSD license.

Here, we show that endogenous targets of the HUSH complex fall into two distinct classes based on the presence or absence of H3K9me3. These classes are further distinguished by their transposon content and differential response to the loss of HUSH. A de novo genomic rearrangement at the Sox2 locus induces a switch from H3K9me3-independent to H3K9me3-associated HUSH targeting, resulting in silencing. We further demonstrate that HUSH interacts with the termination factor WDR82 and-via its component MPP8-with nascent RNA. HUSH accumulates at sites of high RNAPII occupancy including long exons and transcription termination sites in a manner dependent on WDR82 and CPSF. Together, our results uncover the functional diversity of HUSH targets and show that this vertebrate-specific complex exploits evolutionarily ancient transcription termination machinery for co-transcriptional chromatin targeting and genome surveillance.",genome,4.9,Q1,Molecular Ecology

Indeed, the recent sequencing of sarcopterygian and amphibian genomes has revealed that the extant lineages immediately preceding and succeeding this transition harbor an exceptional number of transposable elements and it is tempting to speculate that these sequences might have catalyzed the adaptations that enabled vertebrates to venture into land.
