This reduces small variant genotyping errors by four times relative to the Genome Analysis Toolkit and makes short-read structural variant genotyping of known variants competitive with long-read variant discovery methods.",Nature methods,Q1,39261641,个性化泛基因组;参考偏倚;变异检测;读段映射;局部单倍型采样;k-mer计数;生物信息学;分子生物学,Nature Methods,2024-09-12,10.1038/s41592-024-02407-2,//github.com/vgteam/vg）中实现了这一方法，并针对Giraffe短读比对器进行了测试。我们使用人类泛基因组参考联盟的人类泛基因组图谱，将其准确性与最先进的方法进行了比较。这种方法相对于Genome Analysis Toolkit将小变异基因分型错误降低了四倍，并使已知变异的短读结构变异基因分型达到了与长读变异发现方法相当的竞争力。

An expanded catalogue of sequence variation in the crop includes structurally complex loci that are rich in gene copy number variation. To demonstrate the utility of the pangenome, we focus on four loci involved in disease resistance, plant architecture, nutrient release and trichome development. Novel allelic variation at a powdery mildew resistance locus and population-specific copy number gains in a regulator of vegetative branching were found.

A transformative opportunity lies in exchanging genotype-to-phenotype knowledge between major crops (that is, those cultivated globally) and indigenous crops (that is, those locally cultivated within a circumscribed area)3-5 to enhance our food system. However, species-specific genetic variants and their interactions with desirable natural or engineered mutations pose barriers to achieving predictable phenotypic effects, even between related crops6,7. Here, by establishing a pan-genome of the crop-rich genus Solanum8 and integrating functional genomics and pan-genetics, we show that gene duplication and subsequent paralogue diversification are major obstacles to genotype-to-phenotype predictability. Despite broad conservation of gene macrosynteny among chromosome-scale references for 22 species, including 13 indigenous crops, thousands of gene duplications, particularly within key domestication gene families, exhibited dynamic trajectories in sequence, expression and function. By augmenting our pan-genome with African eggplant cultivars9 and applying quantitative genetics and genome editing, we dissected an intricate history of paralogue evolution affecting fruit size. The loss of a redundant paralogue of the classical fruit size regulator CLAVATA3 (CLV3)10,11 was compensated by a lineage-specific tandem duplication. Subsequent pseudogenization of the derived copy, followed by a large cultivar-specific deletion, created a single fused CLV3 allele that modulates fruit organ number alongside an enzymatic gene controlling the same trait.

To address this, we explore the utilization of mapping-based genome assembly and reference-guided assembly as cost-effective alternative approaches. We assess the efficacy of these approaches in improving the contiguity of Clarias batrachus and Culter alburnus draft genomes. Our findings demonstrate that employing an iterative mapping strategy leads to a reduction in assembly errors. Specifically, after three iterations, the Mismatches per 100 kbp value for the C. batrachus genome decreased from 2447.20 to 2432.67, reaching a minimum of 2422.67 after two iterations. Additionally, the N50 value for the C. batrachus genome increased from 362,143 to 1,315,126 bp, with a maximum of 1,315,403 bp after two iterations. Furthermore, we achieved Mismatches per 100 kbp values of 3.70 for the reference-guided assembly of C. batrachus and 0.34 for C. alburnus.

Nanoformulation of non-essential elements enhancing plant growth and stress tolerance also comes under the umbrella of NFs. NFs have an edge over conventional chemical fertilizers, viz., higher plant biomass and yield using much lesser fertilization, thereby reducing environmental pollution. Foliar and root applications of NFs lead to their successful uptake by the plant, depending on the size, surface charge, and other physicochemical properties of NFs. Smaller NFs can pass through channels on the waxy cuticle depending on the hydrophobicity, while larger NFs pass through the stomatal conduits of leaves. Charge-based adsorption, followed by apoplastic movement and endocytosis, translocates NFs through the root, while the size of NFs influences passage into vascular tissues. Recent transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies throw light on the molecular mechanisms of growth promotion by NFs. The expression levels of nutrient transporter genes are regulated by NFs, controlling uptake and minimizing excess nutrient toxicity. Accelerated growth by NFs is brought about by their extensive regulation of cell division, photosynthesis, carbohydrate, and nitrogen metabolism, as well as the phytohormone-dependent signaling pathways related to development, stress response, and plant defense. NFs mimic Ca,2+ eliciting second messengers and associated proteins in signaling cascades, reaching transcription factors and finally orchestrating gene expression to enhance growth and stress tolerance.

Cell walls are dynamic structures whose composition and integrity can be altered in response to environmental challenges and developmental cues. These wall changes are perceived by plant sensors/receptors to trigger adaptative responses during development and upon stress perception. Plant cell wall damage caused by pathogen infection, wounding, or other stresses leads to the release of wall molecules, such as carbohydrates (glycans), that function as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs are perceived by the extracellular ectodomains (ECDs) of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to activate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and disease resistance. Similarly, glycans released from the walls and extracellular layers of microorganisms interacting with plants are recognized as microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by specific ECD-PRRs triggering PTI responses. The number of oligosaccharides DAMPs/MAMPs identified that are perceived by plants has increased in recent years. However, the structural mechanisms underlying glycan recognition by plant PRRs remain limited. Currently, this knowledge is mainly focused on receptors of the LysM-PRR family, which are involved in the perception of various molecules, such as chitooligosaccharides from fungi and lipo-chitooligosaccharides (i.e., Nod/MYC factors from bacteria and mycorrhiza, respectively) that trigger differential physiological responses. Nevertheless, additional families of plant PRRs have recently been implicated in oligosaccharide/polysaccharide recognition. These include receptor kinases (RKs) with leucine-rich repeat and Malectin domains in their ECDs (LRR-MAL RKs), Catharanthus roseus RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1-LIKE group (CrRLK1L) with Malectin-like domains in their ECDs, as well as wall-associated kinases, lectin-RKs, and LRR-extensins. The characterization of structural basis of glycans recognition by these new plant receptors will shed light on their similarities with those of mammalians involved in glycan perception.

We propose that divergence time among lineages is a key factor driving this variability: as lineages diverge, the extent of gene reuse should decrease due to reductions in allele sharing, functional differentiation among genes, and restructuring of genome architecture. Indeed, we show that many genomic studies of repeated adaptation find that more recently diverged lineages exhibit higher gene reuse during repeated adaptation, but the relationship becomes less clear at older divergence time scales. Thus, future research should explore the factors shaping gene reuse and their interplay across broad divergence time scales for a deeper understanding of evolutionary repeatability.",Trends in ecology & evolution,Q1,38155043,基因组学；分歧时间；重复进化；趋同进化；适应；平行进化,Trends in Ecology & Evolution,2023-12-29,10.1016/j.tree.2023.11.007,随着谱系的分化，由于等位基因共享减少、基因功能分化以及基因组结构重组等因素，基因重用的程度应随之降低。事实上，我们发现许多关于重复适应的基因组研究显示，分化时间较近的谱系在重复适应过程中表现出更高的基因重用程度，但在较老的分化时间尺度上，这一关系变得不那么清晰。因此，未来的研究应探索影响基因重用的因素及其在广泛分化时间尺度上的相互作用，以更深入地理解进化可重复性。

Genetic diversity across a genus can be captured in super-pangenomes, which provide a framework for interpreting genomic variations. Here we report the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of nine wild North American grape genomes, which are phased and scaffolded at chromosome scale. We generate a reference-unbiased super-pangenome using pairwise whole-genome alignment methods, revealing the extent of the genomic diversity among wild grape species from sequence to gene level. The pangenome graph captures genomic variation between haplotypes within a species and across the different species, and it accurately assesses the similarity of hybrids to their parents. The species selected to build the pangenome are a great representation of the genus, as illustrated by capturing known allelic variants in the sex-determining region and for Pierce's disease resistance loci. Using pangenome-wide association analysis, we demonstrate the utility of the super-pangenome by effectively mapping short reads from genus-wide samples and identifying loci associated with salt tolerance in natural populations of grapes.

Gene clustering is complicated by intraspecific duplications and horizontal gene transfers that are frequent in prokaryotes. In consequence, gene clustering methods must deal with a trade-off between identifying vertically transmitted representatives of multicopy gene families, which are recognizable by synteny conservation, and retrieving complete sets of species-level orthologs. We studied the implications of adopting homology, orthology, or synteny conservation as formal criteria for gene clustering by performing comparative analyses of 125 prokaryotic pangenomes. Clustering criteria affect pangenome functional characterization, core genome inference, and reconstruction of ancestral gene content to different extents. Species-wise estimates of pangenome and core genome sizes change by the same factor when using different clustering criteria, allowing robust cross-species comparisons regardless of the clustering criterion. However, cross-species comparisons of genome plasticity and functional profiles are substantially affected by inconsistencies among clustering criteria. Such inconsistencies are driven not only by mobile genetic elements, but also by genes involved in defense, secondary metabolism, and other accessory functions. In some pangenome features, the variability attributed to methodological inconsistencies can even exceed the effect sizes of ecological and phylogenetic variables. Choosing an appropriate criterion for gene clustering is critical to conduct unbiased pangenome analyses. We provide practical guidelines to choose the right method depending on the research goals and the quality of genome assemblies, and a benchmarking dataset to assess the robustness and reproducibility of future comparative studies.",Genome biology,Q1,37904249,"微生物基因组（MAG, Metagenomic Assembly Genome）

Molecular studies of these phenomena have now coalesced into an integrated model of plant immunity involving cell surface and intracellular detection of specific pathogen-derived molecules and proteins culminating in the induction of various cellular responses. Extracellular and intracellular receptors engage distinct signaling processes but converge on many similar outputs with substantial evidence now for integration of these pathways into interdependent networks controlling disease outcomes.

In this review, we provide an update on recent advances in our understanding of SA metabolism, perception, and signal transduction mechanisms in plant immunity. An overarching theme emerges that SA executes its many functions through intricate regulation at multiple steps: SA biosynthesis is regulated both locally and systemically, while its perception occurs through multiple cellular targets, including metabolic enzymes, redox regulators, transcription cofactors, and, most recently, an RNA-binding protein. Moreover, SA orchestrates a complex series of post-translational modifications of downstream signaling components and promotes the formation of biomolecular condensates that function as cellular signalling hubs. SA also impacts wider cellular functions through crosstalk with other plant hormones.

This ""noise"" in expression derives from several sources, including the genomic and cellular environment in which a gene resides. Large-scale maps of genomic environments have revealed the effects of epigenetic modifications and transcription factor occupancy on mean expression levels, but leveraging such maps to explain expression noise will require new methods to assay how expression noise changes at locations across the genome. To address this gap, we present Single-cell Analysis of Reporter Gene Expression Noise and Transcriptome (SARGENT), a method that simultaneously measures the noisiness of reporter genes integrated throughout the genome and the global mRNA profiles of individual reporter-gene-containing cells. Using SARGENT, we perform the first comprehensive genome-wide survey of how genomic locations impact gene expression noise. We find that the mean and noise of expression correlate with different histone modifications. We quantify the intrinsic and extrinsic components of reporter gene noise and, using the associated mRNA profiles, assign the extrinsic component to differences between the CD24+ ""stem-like"" substate and the more ""differentiated"" substate. SARGENT also reveals the effects of transgene integrations on endogenous gene expression, which will help guide the search for ""safe-harbor"" loci.

Viruses maintain a high strain diversity through time that we describe as constant-diversity equilibrium, preventing the hoarding of resources by specific clones. Thus, viruses facilitate the release and degradation of dissolved organic matter in the ocean, which may lead to better ecosystem functioning by linking top-down to bottom-up control.

In these interactions, plant ncRNAs are believed to be sorted into extracellular vesicles (EVs) or other nonvesicular vehicles to pass through cell barriers and trigger trans-kingdom RNA interference (RNAi) in recipient cells from different species. There is evidence that the features of extracellular RNAs and associated RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a role in defining the RNAs to retain in cell or secrete outside cells. Despite the few reports about RNA secretion pathway in plants, the export of extracellular ncRNAs is orchestrated by a series of pathways in plants.

Some species have fluid pangenomes, with a high proportion of genes varying between individual genomes. Other species have less fluid pangenomes, with different genomes tending to contain the same genes. Two main hypotheses have been suggested to explain this variation: differences in species' bacterial lifestyle and effective population size. However, previous studies have not been able to test between these hypotheses because the different features of lifestyle and effective population size are highly correlated with each other, and phylogenetically conserved, making it hard to disentangle their relative importance. We used phylogeny-based analyses, across 126 bacterial species, to tease apart the causal role of different factors. We found that pangenome fluidity was lower in i) host-associated compared with free-living species and ii) host-associated species that are obligately dependent on a host, live inside cells, and are more pathogenic and less motile. In contrast, we found no support for the competing hypothesis that larger effective population sizes lead to more fluid pangenomes.

Here, we constructed a pangenome variation graph for 73 diverse Fusarium oxysporum genomes, a major fungal plant pathogen with a compartmentalized genome that includes conserved core as well as variable accessory chromosomes. To obtain insights into accessory chromosome dynamics, we first constructed a chromosome similarity network using all-vs-all similarity mapping. We identified eleven core chromosomes conserved across all strains and a substantial number of highly variable accessory chromosomes. Some of these accessory chromosomes are host-specific and likely play a role in determining host range. Using a k-mer based approach, we further identified the presence of these accessory chromosomes in all available (581) F. oxysporum assemblies and corroborated the occurrence of host-specific accessory chromosomes. To further analyze the evolution of chromosomes in F. oxysporum, we constructed a pangenome variation graph per group of homologous chromosomes. This reveals that accessory chromosomes are composed of different stretches of accessory regions, and possibly rearrangements between accessory regions gave rise to these mosaic accessory chromosomes. Furthermore, we show that accessory chromosomes are likely horizontally transferred in natural populations.

Pangenome assembly integrates data from multiple individuals to construct a comprehensive genomic landscape, revealing both core and accessory genomic elements. This approach enables the identification of novel genes, structural variations, and gene presence-absence variations, providing insights into species evolution, adaptation, and trait variation. Representing pangenomes requires innovative visualization formats that effectively convey the complex genomic structures and variations. This review delves into contemporary methodologies and recent advancements in constructing pangenomes, particularly in plant genomes. It examines the structure of pangenome representation, including format comparison, conversion, visualization techniques, and their implications for enhancing crop improvement strategies. Earlier comparative studies have illuminated novel gene sequences, copy number variations, and presence-absence variations across diverse crop species. The concept of a pan-genome, which captures multiple genetic variations from a broad spectrum of genotypes, offers a holistic perspective of a species' genetic makeup. However, constructing a pan-genome for plants with larger genomes poses challenges, including managing vast genome sequence data and comprehending the genetic variations within the germplasm. To address these challenges, researchers have explored cost-effective alternatives to encapsulate species diversity in a single assembly known as a pangenome. This involves reducing the volume of genome sequences while focusing on genetic variations. With the growing prominence of the pan-genome concept in plant genomics, several software tools have emerged to facilitate pangenome construction. This review sheds light on developing and utilizing software tools tailored for constructing pan-genomes in plants. It also discusses representation formats suitable for downstream analyses, offering valuable insights into the genetic landscape and evolutionary dynamics of plant species. In summary, this review underscores the significance of pan-genome construction and representation formats in resolving the genetic architecture of plants, particularly those with complex genomes.

But how genome-wide sequence divergence maps to species status is far from clear. While gene sequence divergence is commonly used to delineate bacterial species, its correspondence to established species boundaries has yet to be explored across eukaryotic taxa. Because the processes underlying gene flow differ fundamentally between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, these domains are likely to differ in the relationship between reproductive isolation and genome-wide sequence divergence. In prokaryotes, homologous recombination, the basis of gene flow, depends directly on the degree of genomic sequence divergence, whereas in sexually reproducing eukaryotes, reproductive incompatibility can stem from changes in very few genes. Guided by measures of genome-wide sequence divergence in bacteria, we gauge how genomic criteria correspond to species boundaries in eukaryotes.

Due to gravity, roots establish robust anchorage and shoot, which enables to photosynthesize. It sets optimum posture and develops plant architecture to efficiently use resources like water, nutrients, CO2, and gaseous exchange. Hence, gravitropism is crucial for crop productivity as well as for the growth of plants in challenging climate. Some SGR members are known to affect tiller and shoot angle, organ size, and inflorescence stem in plants. Although the SHOOT GRAVITROPISM (SGR) family plays a key role in regulating the fate of shoot gravitropism, little is known about its function compared to other proteins involved in gravity response in plant cells and tissues. Moreover, less information on the SGR family's physiological activities and biochemical responses in shoot gravitropism is available. This review scrutinizes and highlights the recent developments in shoot gravitropism and provides an outlook for future crop development, multi-application scenarios, and translational research to improve agricultural productivity. Plants have evolved multiple gene families specialized in gravitropic responses, of which the SGR family is highly significant.

In contrast to common resequencing studies that compare whole genome sequencing data with a single reference genome, the construction of a pan-genome (PG) involves the direct comparison of multiple genomes to one another, thereby enabling the detection of genomic sequences and genes not present in the reference, as well as the analysis of gene content diversity. Although multiple studies describing PGs of various plant species have been published in recent years, a better understanding regarding the effect of the computational procedures used for PG construction could guide researchers in making more informed methodological decisions. Here, we examine the effect of several key methodological factors on the obtained gene pool and on gene presence-absence detections by constructing and comparing multiple PGs of Arabidopsis thaliana and cultivated soybean, as well as conducting a meta-analysis on published PGs. These factors include the construction method, the sequencing depth, and the extent of input data used for gene annotation. We observe substantial differences between PGs constructed using three common procedures (de novo assembly and annotation, map-to-pan, and iterative assembly) and that results are dependent on the extent of the input data.

We also found that Pithoviridae genomes are more conservative than other families of giant viruses, with a low and stable proportion (5% to 7%) of genes originating from horizontal transfers. Genome size variation within the family is mainly due to variations in gene duplication rates (from 14% to 28%) and massive invasion by inverted repeats.

The abundance of functional categories across genomes has previously been found to show power law scaling with respect to the total number of functional categories, suggesting that universal constraints shape genomic category abundance. Here, we look across the tree of life to understand how genome evolution may be related to functional scaling. We revisit previous observations of functional genome scaling with an expanded taxonomy by analyzing 3,726 bacterial, 220 archaeal, and 79 unicellular eukaryotic genomes. We find that for some functional classes, scaling is best described by multiple exponents, revealing previously unobserved shifts in scaling as genome-encoded protein annotations increase or decrease. Furthermore, we find that scaling varies between phyletic groups at both the domain and phyla levels and is less universal than previously thought. This variability in functional scaling is not related to taxonomic phylogeny resolved at the phyla level, suggesting that differences in cell plan or physiology outweigh broad patterns of taxonomic evolution. Since genomes are maintained and replicated by the functional proteins encoded by them, these results point to functional degeneracy between taxonomic groups and unique evolutionary trajectories toward these. We also find that individual phyla frequently span scaling exponents of functional classes, revealing that individual clades can move across scaling exponents.

Now, the ability to sequence genomes at an unprecedented pace and scale has allowed biologists to settle decades-long debates and tackle other emerging challenges in speciation research. Here, we review these recent genome-enabled developments in plant speciation. We discuss complications related to identification of reproductive isolation (RI) loci using analyses of the landscape of genomic divergence and highlight the important role that structural variants have in speciation, as increasingly revealed by new sequencing technologies. Further, we review how genomics has advanced what we know of some routes to new species formation, like hybridization or whole-genome duplication, while casting doubt on others, like population bottlenecks and genetic drift. While genomics can fast-track identification of genes and mutations that confer RI, we emphasize that follow-up molecular and field experiments remain critical. Nonetheless, genomics has clarified the outsized role of ancient variants rather than new mutations, particularly early during speciation. We conclude by highlighting promising avenues of future study.

However, efforts to produce high-quality genomes for African taxa are lagging given the limited access to sufficient resources and technologies. The southern African dwarf chameleons (Bradypodion) are a relatively young lineage, with a large body of evidence demonstrating the highly adaptive capacity of these lizards. Bradypodion are known for their habitat specialization, with evidence of convergent phenotypes across the phylogeny. However, the underlying genetic architecture of these phenotypes remains unknown for Bradypodion, and without adequate genomic resources, many evolutionary questions cannot be answered. We present de novo assembled whole genomes for Bradypodion pumilum and Bradypodion ventrale, using Pacific Biosciences long-read sequencing data. BUSCO analysis revealed that 96.36% of single copy orthologs were present in the B. pumilum genome and 94% in B. ventrale. Moreover, these genomes boast scaffold N50 of 389.6 and 374.9 Mb, respectively. Based on a whole genome alignment of both Bradypodion genomes, B. pumilum is highly syntenic with B. ventrale.

It is capable of synchronizing resistance pathways, yet it can also be exploited as a susceptibility factor by viral effectors. ABA fortifies multi-layered defenses on one hand, by activating RNA silencing mechanisms that precisely degrade viral genomes, strengthening plasmodesmal gateways with callose barriers, and priming the transcriptional programs of resistance genes. On the other hand, ABA can augment susceptibility by counteracting other defense hormones, dampening oxidative bursts, and inhibiting antiviral defence proteins. Interestingly, a variety of viruses have independently evolved strategies to manipulate ABA signalling pathways.

Excess or deficient provision of metal/metalloids puts plant's life and survival at risk, thus considered a potent stress for plants. Chloroplasts as an organelle with a high metal demand form a pivotal site within the metal homeostasis network. Therefore, the metal-mediated electron transport chain (ETC) in chloroplasts is a primary target site of metal/metalloid-induced stresses. Both excess and deficient availability of metal/metalloids threatens plant's photosynthesis in several ways. Energy demands from the photosynthetic carbon reactions should be in balance with energy output of ETC. Malfunctioning of ETC components as a result of metal/metalloid stress initiates photoinhiition. A feedback inhibition from carbon fixation process also impedes the ETC. Metal stress impairs antioxidant enzyme activity, pigment biosynthesis, and stomatal function.

Homoeologous chromosomes (chromosomes with common shared ancestry) may undergo recombination immediately after allopolyploid formation and continue over successive generations. The outcome of this meiotic pairing behavior is dynamic and complex. Homoeologous exchanges (HEs) may lead to the formation of unbalanced gametes, reduced fertility, and selective disadvantage. By contrast, HEs could act as sources of novel evolutionary substrates, shifting the relative dosage of parental gene copies, generating novel phenotypic diversity, and helping the establishment of neo-allopolyploids. However, HE patterns vary among lineages, across generations, and even within individual genomes and chromosomes.

In this perspective, we consider a possible role for discordance between gene trees and species trees in the interpretation of phylogenetic signal in studies of community ecology. Modern genomic data show that the evolutionary histories of many taxa are better described by a patchwork of histories that vary along the genome rather than a single species tree. If a subset of genomic loci harbour trait-related genetic variation, then the phylogeny at these loci may be more informative of interspecific trait differences than the genome background. We develop a simple method to detect loci harbouring phylogenetic signal and demonstrate its application through a proof-of-principle analysis of Penicillium genomes and pairwise interaction strength.

However, it is difficult to obtain their high-quality whole genomes because of the prevalence of polyploidy and/or high genomic heterozygosity. Whole genomes of 123 medicinal plants were published until September 2022. These published genome sequences were investigated in this review, covering their classification, research teams, ploidy, medicinal functions, and sequencing strategies. More than 1,000 institutes or universities around the world and 50 countries are conducting research on medicinal plant genomes. Diploid species account for a majority of sequenced medicinal plants. The whole genomes of plants in the Poaceae family are the most studied. Almost 40% of the published papers studied species with tonifying, replenishing, and heat-cleaning medicinal effects. Medicinal plants are still in the process of domestication as compared with crops, thereby resulting in unclear genetic backgrounds and the lack of pure lines, thus making their genomes more difficult to complete. In addition, there is still no clear routine framework for a medicinal plant to obtain a high-quality whole genome. Herein, a clear and complete strategy has been originally proposed for creating a high-quality whole genome of medicinal plants.

Chromium is very harmful to plants due to its effects on many physiological and metabolic pathways culminating in a negative impact on plant's growth, development, and ability to take up nutrients. Plants have developed physiological, biochemical, and molecular ways of defense against Cr, such as by augmenting antioxidant potential to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS). A number of genes have been discovered to play a significant role in the defense mechanisms of plants against Cr, for example, genes associated with the activation of phytochelatins, metallothioneins, and those of enzymes like glutathione-S-transferases. Along with this, a few miRNAs have been found to be associated in alleviating Cr stress and, to augment plant tolerance by controlling transcription factors, HSPs, and the expression of a few proteins and hormones. Defense pathway genes and miRNAs have been used for the generation of transgenic phytoremediator plants. Not only do the transgenic plants have a higher tolerance to Cr, but they also act as hyperaccumulators for Cr and have the potential to remediate other heavy metals. This article describes about environmental Cr contamination, Cr effects on plants, different genes and miRNAs involved in Cr stress mitigation and use of candidate genes, microRNAs for creating transgenic plant systems for phytoremediation, and the applications of CRISPR technology.

With belowground focus we systematically decomposed both of these directions into plant and (root and rhizosphere) microbiome components to identify methodological challenges and research priorities. We found that the bidirectionality of plant microbiome interactions presents a challenge for genetic studies. Establishing causality is particularly difficult when a plant mutant has both, an altered phenotype and an altered microbiome. Is the mutation directly affecting the microbiome (e.g., through root exudates), which then causes an altered phenotype of the plant and/or is the altered microbiome the consequence of the mutation altering the plant's phenotype (e.g., root architecture)? Here, we put forward that feedback experiments allow to separate cause and effect and furthermore, they are useful for investigating plant interactions with complex microbiomes in natural soils. They especially allow to investigate the plant genetic basis how plants respond to soil microbiomes and we stress that such microbiome feedbacks are understudied compared to the mechanisms contributing to microbiome assembly.

Such heritable traits emerge in response to different environmental niches and can have a profound influence on microbial community dynamics. As a consequence, any individual genome or population will contain merely a fraction of the total genetic diversity of any operationally defined ""species"", whose ecological potential can thus be only fully understood by studying all of their genomes and the genes therein. This concept, known as the pangenome, is valuable for studying microbial ecology and evolution, as it partitions genomes into core (present in all the genomes from a species, and responsible for housekeeping and species-level niche adaptation among others) and accessory regions (present only in some, and responsible for intra-species differentiation). Here we present SuperPang, an algorithm producing pangenome assemblies from a set of input genomes of varying quality, including metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). SuperPang runs in linear time and its results are complete, non-redundant, preserve gene ordering and contain both coding and non-coding regions. Our approach provides a modular view of the pangenome, identifying operons and genomic islands, and allowing to track their prevalence in different populations. We illustrate this by analysing intra-species diversity in Polynucleobacter, a bacterial genus ubiquitous in freshwater ecosystems, characterized by their streamlined genomes and their ecological versatility.

Recently proposed models yielded promising results for the task of genome sequence classification. Nevertheless, these models often ignore the sequential nature of nucleotides, which is crucial for revealing their underlying structure and function. To address this limitation, we present SPM4GAC, a sequential pattern mining (SPM)-based framework to analyze and classify the macromolecule genome sequences of viruses. First, a large dataset containing the genome sequences of various RNA viruses is developed and transformed into a suitable format. On the transformed dataset, algorithms for SPM are used to identify frequent sequential patterns of nucleotide bases. The obtained frequent sequential patterns of bases are then used as features to classify different viruses.

We compared the performances of these methods on simulated experiments using alien fragments obtained from both artificial and real genomes. Our results indicate that among the nine genomic signatures evaluated, genomic signature frequency and full probability performed the best.

This may adversely affect crop and other non-target plants because the plant's resilience and resistance largely rely on plant-associated microbes. Ubiquitous glyphosate residues in soil and how they impact mutualistic microbes inhabiting the aboveground plant parts are largely unexplored. We studied the effects of herbicide residues in soil on Epichloë sp., which are common endophytic symbionts inhabiting aerial parts of cool-season grasses. In this symbiosis, the obligate symbiont subsists entirely on its host plant, and in exchange, it provides alkaloids conferring resistance to herbivores for the host grass that invests little in its own chemical defence. We first show decreased growth of Epichloë endophytes in vitro when directly exposed to two concentrations of glyphosate or glyphosate-based herbicides. Second, we provide evidence for a reduction of Epichloë-derived, insect-toxic loline alkaloids in endophyte-symbiotic meadow fescue (F. pratensis) plants growing in soil with a glyphosate history. Plants were grown for 2 years in an open field site, and natural herbivore infestation was correlated with the glyphosate-mediated reduction of loline alkaloid concentrations.

We applied IGTminer to create a nuclear organellar gene (NOG) map across 67 genomes covering 15 Poaceae species, including important crops. The resulting NOGs were verified by experiments and sequencing data sets. Our analysis revealed that most NOGs were recently transferred and lineage specific and that Triticeae species tended to have more NOGs than other Poaceae species. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) had a higher retention rate of NOGs than maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa), and the retained NOGs were likely involved in photosynthesis and translation pathways. Large numbers of NOG clusters were aggregated in hexaploid wheat during 2 rounds of polyploidization, contributing to the genetic diversity among modern wheat accessions.

While domestic animals tend to have complex routes of origin and migration, suggesting a possible omission of some population-specific sequences in the current reference genome. Conversely, the pangenome is a collection of all DNA sequences of a species that contains sequences shared by all individuals (core genome) and is also able to display sequence information unique to each individual (variable genome). The progress of pangenome research in humans, plants and domestic animals has proved that the missing genetic components and the identification of large structural variants (SVs) can be explored through pangenomic studies. Many individual specific sequences have been shown to be related to biological adaptability, phenotype and important economic traits. The maturity of technologies and methods such as third-generation sequencing, Telomere-to-telomere genomes, graphic genomes, and reference-free assembly will further promote the development of pangenome. In the future, pangenome combined with long-read data and multi-omics will help to resolve large SVs and their relationship with the main economic traits of interest in domesticated animals, providing better insights into animal domestication, evolution and breeding.

Autophagy enables plants to adapt to and manage severe environmental conditions, such as nutrient starvation, high-intensity light stress, and heat stress, leading to intracellular remodeling and physiological changes in response to stress. In the past, plant autophagy research lagged behind similar studies in yeast and mammals; however, recent advances have greatly expanded our understanding of plant-specific autophagy mechanisms and functions.

When mapping reads to a pangenome graph, prioritizing alignments that are consistent with the known haplotypes improves genotyping accuracy. However, the existing rigorous formulations for colinear chaining and alignment problems do not consider the haplotype paths in a pangenome graph. This often leads to spurious read alignments to those paths that are unlikely recombinations of the known haplotypes. In this paper, we develop novel formulations and algorithms for sequence-to-graph alignment and chaining problems. Inspired by the genotype imputation models, we assume that a query sequence is an imperfect mosaic of reference haplotypes. Accordingly, we introduce a recombination penalty in the scoring functions for each haplotype switch. First, we solve haplotype-aware sequence-to-graph alignment in [Formula: see text] time, where Q is the query sequence, E is the set of edges, and H is the set of haplotypes represented in the graph. To complement our solution, we prove that an algorithm significantly faster than [Formula: see text] is impossible under the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH). Second, we propose a haplotype-aware chaining algorithm that runs in [Formula: see text] time after graph preprocessing, where N is the count of input anchors. We then establish that a chaining algorithm significantly faster than [Formula: see text] is impossible under SETH. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented our chaining algorithm in the Minichain aligner. By aligning sequences sampled from the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to a pangenome graph of 60 MHC haplotypes, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better consistency with ground-truth recombinations compared with a haplotype-agnostic algorithm.",Genome research,Q1,39013594,序列比对;泛基因组图;单倍型意识;重组惩罚;时间复杂度;锚点链;Minichain;生物信息学;分子生物学,Genome Research,2024-07-17,10.1101/gr.279143.124,见原文\]时间内解决了单倍型感知的序列到图谱比对问题，其中Q是查询序列，E是边集，H是图中表示的单倍型集合。为了补充我们的解决方案，我们证明了在强指数时间假设（SETH）下，比\[公式：见原文\]更快的算法是不可能实现的。其次，我们提出了一种单倍型感知的链式算法，该算法在图预处理后以\[公式：见原文\]的时间复杂度运行，其中N是输入锚点的数量。我们进一步证明了在SETH下，比\[公式：见原文\]更快的链式算法也是不可能的。作为概念验证，我们将我们的链式算法实现于Minichain比对器中。通过将从人类主要组织相容性复合体（MHC）采样的序列比对到包含60个MHC单倍型的泛基因组图谱上，我们展示了我们的算法相比无单倍型感知的算法，能更好地与真实的重组结果保持一致性。

Ascorbate oxidase (AO) is a blue copper oxidase that is responsible for the oxidation of AsA with the concomitant production of water. For many decades, AO was erroneously postulated as an enzyme without any obvious advantage, as it decreases the AsA pool size and thus is expected to weaken plant stress resistance. It was only a decade ago that this perspective shifted towards the fundamental role of AO in orchestrating both AsA and oxygen levels by influencing the overall redox balance in the extracellular matrix. Consistent with its localization in the apoplast, AO is involved in cell expansion, division, resource allocation, and overall plant yield. An increasing number of transgenic studies has demonstrated that AO can also facilitate communication between the surrounding environment and the cell, as its gene expression is highly responsive to factors such as hormonal signaling, oxidative stress, and mechanical injury.

Although fungi and plants lack intermediate filaments, their dynamic structural network of actin filaments and microtubules regulates cell shape, division, polarity, and vesicular trafficking. However, the specialized functions of the cytoskeleton during plant-fungus interactions remain elusive. Recent reports demonstrate that the plant cytoskeleton responds to signal cues and pathogen invasion through remodeling, thereby coordinating immune receptor trafficking, membrane microdomain formation, aggregation of organelles, and transport of defense compounds. Emerging evidence also suggests that cytoskeleton remodeling further regulates host immunity by triggering salicylic acid signaling, reactive oxygen species generation, and pathogenesis-related gene expression. During host invasion, fungi undergo systematic cytoskeleton remodeling, which is crucial for successful host penetration and colonization. Furthermore, phytohormones act as an essential regulator of plant cytoskeleton dynamics and are frequently targeted by fungal effectors to disrupt the host's growth-defense balance.

Plants have evolved intricate relationships with a diverse array of microorganisms inhabiting their roots, leaves, and other plant tissues. This microbiota mainly includes bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoans, and viruses, forming a dynamic and interconnected network within and around the plant. Through mutualistic or cooperative interactions, these microbes contribute to various aspects of plant health and development. The direct mechanisms of the plant microbiome include the enhancement of plant growth and development through nutrient acquisition. Microbes have the ability to solubilize essential minerals, fix atmospheric nitrogen, and convert organic matter into accessible forms, thereby augmenting the nutrient pool available to the plant. Additionally, the microbiome helps plants to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses, such as pathogen attacks and adverse environmental conditions, by priming the plant's immune responses, antagonizing phytopathogens, and improving stress tolerance. Furthermore, the plant microbiome plays a vital role in phytohormone regulation, facilitating hormonal balance within the plant. This regulation influences various growth processes, including root development, flowering, and fruiting. Microbial communities can also produce secondary metabolites, which directly or indirectly promote plant growth, development, and health. Understanding the functional potential of the plant microbiome has led to innovative agricultural practices, such as microbiome-based biofertilizers and biopesticides, which harness the power of beneficial microorganisms to enhance crop yields while reducing the dependency on chemical inputs.

We introduce a pangenome-wide association mapping approach that examines assembly path similarities within the graph to reveal an association between two most likely serial alleles of a complex structural variant (SV) 66 kb upstream of KIT and facial depigmentation. The complex SV contains a variable number of tandemly duplicated 14.3 kb repeats, consisting of LTRs, LINEs, and other repetitive elements, leading to misleading alignments of short and long reads when using a linear reference.

However, plant-associated microbial community can be shaped by several factors including plant phenotype and cropping system. Thus, understanding the interplay between microbiome assembly during the onset of plant-pathogen interactions and long-lasting resistance traits in ligneous plants remains a major challenge. To date, such attempts were mainly investigated in herbaceous plants, due to their phenotypic characteristics and their short life cycle. However, only few studies have focused on the microbial structure, dynamic and their drivers in perennial ligneous plants. Ligneous plants coevolved in interaction with specific fungal and bacterial communities that differ from those of annual plants.

Although phage therapy is one of promising strategies for dealing with MDR bacteria, the main challenges of phage therapeutics include accumulation of phage resistant mutations and acquisition of the phage defense systems. To systematically evaluate the impact of (pro)phages in shaping genetic and evolutionary diversity of S. maltophilia, we collected 166 S. maltophilia isolates from three hospitals in southern China to analyze its pangenome, virulence factors, prophage regions, and anit-viral immune systems. Pangenome analysis indicated that there are 1328 saturated core genes and 26961 unsaturated accessory genes in the pangenome, suggesting existence of highly variable parts of S. maltophilia genome. The presence of genes in relation to T3SS and T6SS mechanisms suggests the great potential to secrete toxins by the S. maltophilia population, which is contrary to the conventional notion of low-virulence of S. maltophilia. Additionally, we characterized the pan-immune system maps of these clinical isolates against phage infections and revealed the co-harboring of CBASS and anti-CBASS in some strains, suggesting a never-ending arms race and the co-evolutionary dynamic between bacteria and phages. Furthermore, our study predicted 310 prophage regions in S. maltophilia with high genetic diversity. Six viral defense systems were found to be located at specific position of the S. maltophilia prophage genomes, indicating potential evolution of certain site/region similar to bacterial 'defense islands' in prophage.

Recent work has demonstrated that significant biases may be introduced into downstream phylogenetic analyses from processing genomic data; however, it remains unclear whether there are interactions among bioinformatic parameters or biases introduced through the choice of reference genome for sequence alignment and variant calling. We address these knowledge gaps by employing a combination of simulated and empirical data sets to investigate the extent to which the choice of reference genome in upstream bioinformatic processing of genomic data influences phylogenetic inference, as well as the way that reference genome choice interacts with bioinformatic filtering choices and phylogenetic inference method. We demonstrate that more stringent minor allele filters bias inferred trees away from the true species tree topology, and that these biased trees tend to be more imbalanced and have a higher center of gravity than the true trees. We find the greatest topological accuracy when filtering sites for minor allele count (MAC) >3-4 in our 51-taxa data sets, while tree center of gravity was closest to the true value when filtering for sites with MAC >1-2. In contrast, filtering for missing data increased accuracy in the inferred topologies; however, this effect was small in comparison to the effect of minor allele filters and may be undesirable due to a subsequent mutation spectrum distortion. The bias introduced by these filters differs based on the reference genome used in short read alignment, providing further support that choosing a reference genome for alignment is an important bioinformatic decision with implications for downstream analyses.

Here, we present PanKmer, a toolkit designed for reference-free analysis of pangenome datasets consisting of dozens to thousands of individual genomes.

It also includes functions for downstream analysis of the k-mer index, such as calculating sequence similarity statistics between individuals at whole-genome or local scales. For example, k-mers can be ""anchored"" in any individual genome to quantify sequence variability or conservation at a specific locus. This facilitates workflows with various biological applications, e.g. identifying cases of hybridization between plant species.

For species-level datasets, fast pangenome inference tools have been developed. However, tools applicable to more diverse datasets are currently slow and scale poorly. Here, we introduce SCARAP, a program containing three modules for comparative genomics analyses: a fast and scalable pangenome inference module, a direct core genome inference module, and a module for subsampling representative genomes. When benchmarked against existing tools, the SCARAP pan module proved up to an order of magnitude faster with comparable accuracy. The core module was validated by comparing its result against a core genome extracted from a full pangenome. The sample module demonstrated the rapid sampling of genomes with decreasing novelty. Applied to a dataset of over 31 000 Lactobacillales genomes, SCARAP showcased its ability to derive a representative pangenome. Finally, we applied the novel concept of gene fixation frequency to this pangenome, showing that Lactobacillales genes that are prevalent but rarely fixate in species often encode bacteriophage functions.

Novel genome sequence, circular genome and variable genome length led to nomenclature inconsistencies. Since vast knowledge has already accumulated in the past two decades with inconsistent nomenclature, the insights gained on a genome could not be easily extendable to other genomes. Therefore, the present study aims to perform comparative genomics studies in WSSV on uniform nomenclature. We have combined the standard mummer tool with custom scripts to develop missing regions finder (MRF) that documents the missing genome regions and coding sequences in virus genomes in comparison to a reference genome and in its annotation nomenclature. The procedure was implemented as web tool and in command-line interface. Using MRF, we have documented the missing coding sequences in WSSV and explored their role in virulence through application of phylogenomics, machine learning models and homologous genes. We have tabulated and depicted the missing genome regions, missing coding sequences and deletion hotspots in WSSV on a common annotation nomenclature and attempted to link them to virus virulence. It was observed that the ubiquitination, transcription regulation and nucleotide metabolism might be essentially required for WSSV pathogenesis; and the structural proteins, VP19, VP26 and VP28 are essential for virus assembly. Few minor structural proteins in WSSV would act as envelope glycoproteins. We have also demonstrated the advantage of MRF in providing detailed graphic/tabular output in less time and also in handling of low-complexity, repeat-rich and highly similar regions of the genomes using other virus cases. Pathogenic virus research benefits from tools that could directly indicate the missing genomic regions and coding sequences between isolates/strains. In virus research, the analyses performed in this study provides an advancement to find the differences between genomes and to quickly identify the important coding sequences/genomes that require early attention from researchers.

Viruses infecting bacteria, known as bacteriophages or phages, play a key role in modulating bacterial communities within environments. High-quality phage genome sequences are essential for advancing our understanding of phage biology, enabling comparative genomics studies and developing phage-based diagnostic tools. Most available viral identification tools consider individual sequences to determine whether they are of viral origin. As a result of challenges in viral assembly, fragmentation of genomes can occur, and existing tools may recover incomplete genome fragments. Therefore, the identification and characterization of novel phage genomes remain a challenge, leading to the need of improved approaches for phage genome recovery. We introduce Phables, a new computational method to resolve phage genomes from fragmented viral metagenome assemblies. Phables identifies phage-like components in the assembly graph, models each component as a flow network, and uses graph algorithms and flow decomposition techniques to identify genomic paths. Experimental results of viral metagenomic samples obtained from different environments show that Phables recovers on average over 49% more high-quality phage genomes compared to existing viral identification tools. Furthermore, Phables can resolve variant phage genomes with over 99% average nucleotide identity, a distinction that existing tools are unable to make.

Aligning sequences to a graph is critical for pangenome-based resequencing. The seed-chain-extend heuristic works by finding short exact matches between a sequence and a graph. In this heuristic, colinear chaining helps identify a good cluster of exact matches that can be combined to form an alignment. Colinear chaining algorithms have been extensively studied for aligning two sequences with various gap costs, including linear, concave, and convex cost functions. However, extending these algorithms for sequence-to-graph alignment presents significant challenges. Recently, Makinen et al. introduced a sparse dynamic programming framework that exploits the small path cover property of acyclic pangenome graphs, enabling efficient chaining. However, this framework does not consider gap costs, limiting its practical effectiveness. We address this limitation by developing novel problem formulations and provably good chaining algorithms that support a variety of gap cost functions. These functions are carefully designed to enable fast chaining algorithms whose time requirements are parameterized in terms of the size of the minimum path cover. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared with existing aligners.

Despite extensive knowledge of virulence mechanisms, understanding the factors driving host specificity remains limited. In this study, we performed a comprehensive pangenome-wide analysis of S. enterica to identify potential loci determining preference towards certain hosts. We used a dataset of high-quality genome assemblies grouped into 300 reference clusters with a special focus on four host groups: humans, pigs, cattle, and birds. The reconstructed pangenome was shown to be open and enriched with the accessory component implying high genetic diversity. Notably, phylogenetic inferences did not correspond to the distribution of affected hosts, as large compact phylogenetic groups were absent. By performing a pangenome-wide association study, we identified potential host specificity determinants. These included multiple genes encoding proteins involved in distinct infection stages, e.g., secretion systems, surface structures, transporters, transcription regulators, etc. We also identified antibiotic resistance loci in host-adapted strains. Functional annotation corroborated the results obtained with significant enrichments related to stress response, antibiotic resistance, ion transport, and surface or extracellular localization.

It, however, was shown to infect a wide range of hosts apart from vertebrates such as insects or plants as well, being either pathogenic or growth-promoting for the latter. Despite being extensively studied in terms of virulence mechanisms during human infections, there has been little evidence of which factors determine S. marcescens host specificity. On that account, we analyzed S. marcescens pangenome to reveal possible specificity factors. We selected 73 high-quality genome assemblies of complete level and reconstructed the respective pangenome and reference phylogeny based on core genes alignment. To find an optimal pipeline, we tested current pangenomic tools and obtained several phylogenetic inferences. The pangenome was rich in its accessory component and was considered open according to the Heaps' law. We then applied the pangenome-wide associating method (pan-GWAS) and predicted positively associated gene clusters attributed to three host groups, namely, humans, insects, and plants. According to the results, significant factors relating to human infections included transcriptional regulators, lipoproteins, ABC transporters, and membrane proteins. Host preference toward insects, in its turn, was associated with diverse enzymes, such as hydrolases, isochorismatase, and N-acetyltransferase with the latter possibly exerting a neurotoxic effect. Finally, plant infection may be conducted through type VI secretion systems and modulation of plant cell wall synthesis. Interestingly, factors associated with plants also included putative growth-promoting proteins like enzymes performing xenobiotic degradation and releasing ammonium irons. We also identified overrepresented functional annotations within the sets of specificity factors and found that their functional characteristics fell into separate clusters, thus, implying that host adaptation is represented by diverse functional pathways. Finally, we found that mobile genetic elements bore specificity determinants. In particular, prophages were mainly associated with factors related to humans, while genetic islands-with insects and plants, respectively. In summary, functional enrichments coupled with pangenomic inferences allowed us to hypothesize that the respective host preference is carried out through distinct molecular mechanisms of virulence.

In the era of next-generation sequencing, thousands of strains from this genus have now been sequenced as part of isolated studies that focus on outbreak characterization, host range, diversity, and virulence factor identification. However, these data have not been synthesized and we lack a comprehensive phylogeny for the genus, with some species designations in public databases still relying on phenotypic similarities and representative sequence typing. The extent of genetic cohesiveness among Xanthomonas strains, the distribution of virulence factors across strains, and the impact of evolutionary history on host range across the genus are also poorly understood. In this study, we present a pangenome analysis of 1,910 diverse Xanthomonas genomes, highlighting their evolutionary relationships, the distribution of virulence-associated genes across strains, and rates of horizontal gene transfer. We find a number of broadly conserved classes of virulence factors and considerable diversity in the Type 3 Secretion Systems (T3SSs) and Type 3 Secreted Effector (T3SE) repertoires of different Xanthomonas species. We also use these data to re-assign incorrectly classified strains to phylogenetically informed species designations and find evidence of both monophyletic host specificity and convergent evolution of phylogenetically distant strains to the same host. Finally, we explore the role of recombination in maintaining genetic cohesion within the Xanthomonas genus as a result of both ancestral and recent recombination events. Understanding the evolutionary history of Xanthomonas species and the relationship of key virulence factors with host-specificity provides valuable insight into the mechanisms through which Xanthomonas species shift between hosts and will enable us to develop more robust resistance strategies against these highly virulent pathogens.",Frontiers in microbiology,Q1,37476668,III型分泌系统；泛基因组；毒力因子；重组；效应蛋白；比较基因组学；黄单胞菌；植物病原菌,Frontiers in Plant Science,2023-07-21,10.3389/fmicb.2023.1213261,"黄单胞菌属（Xanthomonas）是数百种植物病害的致病菌，其中许多为经济上重要的作物。在新一代测序技术的时代，已有数千株该属细菌被单独研究以表征爆发、宿主范围、多样性以及毒力因子鉴定，从而完成测序工作。然而，这些数据尚未被综合分析，我们缺乏对该属的全面系统发育树，一些物种的分类仍依赖于表型相似性和代表性序列分型。黄单胞菌属不同菌株间的遗传一致性程度、毒力因子在菌株间的分布以及进化历史对整个属宿主范围的影响也尚不明确。本研究通过分析来自1,910个多样化黄单胞菌基因组的泛基因组，揭示了它们的进化关系、毒力相关基因在菌株间的分布以及水平基因转移的速率。我们发现了一些广泛保守的毒力因子类别，并且不同黄单胞菌物种的III型分泌系统（T3SS）和III型分泌效应蛋白（T3SE）库表现出相当大的多样性。此外，我们利用这些数据重新分配了错误分类的菌株到基于系统发育的物种名称，并发现了亲缘关系较远的菌株对同一宿主表现出单系宿主特异性和趋同进化的证据。最后，我们探讨了重组在维持黄单胞菌属遗传一致性中的作用，这种一致性源于祖先和近期的重组事件。理解黄单胞菌物种的进化历史及其关键毒力因子与宿主特异性之间的关系，为我们提供了关于黄单胞菌物种如何在宿主间转换的重要见解，并将帮助我们开发更有效的抗病策略来应对这些高毒力病原体。"

Biocontrol bacteria capable of providing beneficial effect in crop plant growth and health, have been developed for several decades. It highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the colonization mechanisms employed by biocontrol bacteria to enhance their efficacy in plant pathogen control. The present review deals with the in-depth understanding of steps involved in host colonization by biocontrol bacteria. The colonization process starts from the root zone, where biocontrol bacteria establish initial interactions with the plant's root system. Moving beyond the roots, biocontrol bacteria migrate and colonize other plant organs, including stems, leaves, and even flowers. Also, the present review attempts to explore the mechanisms facilitating bacterial movement within the plant such as migrating through interconnected spaces such as vessels or in the apoplast, and applying quorum sensing or extracellular enzymes during colonization and what is needed to establish a long-term association within a plant. The impacts on microbial community dynamics, nutrient cycling, and overall plant health are discussed, emphasizing the intricate relationships between biocontrol bacteria and the plant's microbiome and the benefits to the plant's above-ground parts, the biocontrol 40 bacteria confer.

These growth-defence trade-offs have important implications for plant fitness and productivity and influence the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions. Biotic stress strongly affects plant cells' primary metabolism, including photosynthesis and respiration, the main source of energy and carbon skeletons for plant growth, development, and defence. Although the nature of photosynthetic limitations imposed by pathogens is variable, infection often increases photorespiratory pressure, generating conditions that promote ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate oxygenation, leading to a metabolic shift from assimilation to photorespiration. Photorespiration, the significant metabolic flux following photosynthesis, protects the photosynthetic apparatus from photoinhibition. However, recent studies reveal that its role is far beyond photoprotection. The intermediates of the photorespiratory cycle regulate photosynthesis, and photorespiration interacts with the metabolic pathways of nitrogen and sulphur, shaping the primary metabolism for stress responses.

Nanomaterials may improve plant growth and enhance crop productivity by handling the conditions considered stressful for plants in a sustainable and ecofriendly manner. Selenium (Se) has been put into the category of beneficial elements in plants. Se-enriched crops present a successful choice of dietary resource for Se-supplemented food and feed owing to their high bioavailability and accessibility. Researchers from distinct areas, including both nanoscience and plant science, should encourage emerging innovations that are linked with abiotic stress in crop production.

Increasing evidence of earlier research revealed that SeNPs could enhance plant growth and development, nutrient bioavailability, soil fertility, and stress response while maintaining environmental safety. Meanwhile, some earlier studies reported that SeNPs might have a multilateral influence on plants dependent on diverse Se nanomaterial traits, doses, and plant species.

The introduction of chemical fertilizers and pesticides was a major component of the Green Revolution initiated in the 1960s that greatly boosted crop production. However, the massive application of agrochemicals also has adverse consequences on the environment and animal/human health. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the connections between stress caused by overfertilization (or low bioavailability of nutrients) and immune responses is a timely and novel field of research with important implications for disease control in crop species. Optimizing nutrient management practices tailored to specific environmental conditions will be crucial in maximizing crop production using environmentally friendly systems.",International journal of molecular sciences,Q1,40004243,植物免疫；营养物；生物胁迫；抗病性；病原体；非生物胁迫；微小RNA（微RNA）,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2025-02-26,10.3390/ijms26041780,植物始终暴露于非生物和生物胁迫之下，这些胁迫严重影响作物的产量和品质。协调调控植物对复合非生物/生物胁迫的响应需要由每种胁迫引发的信号通路之间的相互作用。相互连接的信号通路进一步微调植物的胁迫响应，使植物能够有效应对这些胁迫。植物的营养状况可能通过增强或削弱植物免疫反应以及调节病原体的致病程序来影响抗病性。本文讨论了在当前农业实践中，关于营养胁迫、缺乏或过量与免疫信号通路之间相互作用的理解进展。化学肥料和农药的引入是20世纪60年代启动的绿色革命的重要组成部分，极大地提高了作物产量。然而，大量使用农用化学品也对环境和动物/人类健康产生了不利影响。因此，深入研究过度施肥（或养分生物有效性低）引起的胁迫与免疫反应之间的联系是一个及时且新颖的研究领域，在作物物种的病害控制方面具有重要意义。优化针对特定环境条件的养分管理实践将是利用环境友好型系统最大化作物产量的关键所在。

However, its host range is much broader. It causes diseases of sunflower, potato, tomato, carrots, sweet potato, radish, squash, cucumber, and chrysanthemum. To explain this phenomenon, a comprehensive pathogenomic and phenomic characterisation of P. betavasculorum species was performed. Genomes of P. betavasculorum strains isolated from potato, sunflower, and artichoke were sequenced and compared with those from sugar beet isolates. Metabolic profiling and pathogenomic analyses were conducted to assess virulence determinants and adaptation potential. Pathogenicity assays were performed on potato tubers and chicory leaves to confirm in silico predictions of disease symptoms. Phenotypic assays were also conducted to assess the strains ability to synthesise homoserine lactones and siderophores. The genome size ranged from 4.675 to 4.931 kbp, and GC % was between 51.0% and 51.2%. The pangenome of P. betavasculorum is open and comprises, on average, 4,220 gene families. Of these, 83% of genes are the core genome, and 2% of the entire pangenome are unique genes. Strains isolated from sugar beet have a smaller pangenome size and a higher number of unique genes than those from other plants. Interestingly, genomes of strains from artichoke and sunflower share 391 common CDS that are not present in the genomes of other strains from sugar beet or potato. Those strains have only one unique gene. All strains could use numerous sugars as building materials and energy sources and possessed a high repertoire of virulence determinants in the genomes. P. betavasculorum strains were able to cause disease symptoms on potato tubers and chicory leaves. They were also able to synthesise homoserine lactones and siderophores. The findings underscore the adaptability of P. betavasculorum to diverse hosts and environments. Strains adapted to plants with high sugar content in tissues have a different composition of fatty acids in membranes and a different mechanism of replenishing nitrogen in case of deficiency of this compound than strains derived from other plant species.

Plant root exudates are composed of primary metabolites, secondary metabolites, and macro-molecules such as organic acids. Certain organic acids in root exudates can attract pathogenic microbes in soil and promote infection. Meanwhile, secretions from soil microbes can also alter the compositions of root exudates and enhance the pathogenicity towards the target host plant. Examples of toxins in microbial secretions include polyketides and thaxtomins. The pathogenicity of plant microbes is mediated by the dynamic exchange of metabolites between the pathogen and the host plant. By deciphering this metabolite-mediated infection process, targeted strategies can be developed to promote plant resistance to soil pathogens. Examples of the strategies include the manipulation of root exudate composition and the blocking of metabolite signals that promote microbial infection. Other possibilities include minimizing the harmfulness of pathogenic microbial secretions to plants by habituating the plants to the toxin, genetically engineering plants to enhance their pathogen resistance, and treating plants with beneficial hormones and microbes.

Among the crucial orchestrators of these responses is the CBL-CIPK pathway, comprising calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) and CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). While CIPKs act as serine/threonine protein kinases, transmitting calcium signals, CBLs function as calcium sensors, influencing the plant's response to abiotic stress.

This family has a genome size of ca. 1 Mb and only 1 bp as median intergenic distance, exceeding values found in other abundant microbes such as SAR11, OM43 and Prochlorococcus. This genomic simplification led to a reduction in the biosynthesis of essential molecules, DNA repair-related genes, and the ability to sense and respond to environmental factors, which could suggest an evolutionary dependence on other co-occurring microbes for survival (Black Queen hypothesis).

The yeast Torulaspora delbrueckii is gaining importance for biotechnology but little is known about its population structure, variation in gene content or possible domestication routes. Here, we show that T. delbrueckii is composed of five major clades. Among the three European clades, a lineage associated with the wild arboreal niche is sister to the two other lineages that are linked to anthropic environments, one to wine fermentations and the other to diverse sources including dairy products and bread dough (Mix-Anthropic clade). Using 64 genomes we assembled the pangenome and the variable genome of T. delbrueckii. A comparison with Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that the weight of the variable genome in the pangenome of T. delbrueckii is considerably smaller. An association of gene content and ecology supported the hypothesis that the Mix-Anthropic clade has the most specialized genome and indicated that some of the exclusive genes were implicated in galactose and maltose utilization. More detailed analyses traced the acquisition of a cluster of GAL genes in strains associated with dairy products and the expansion and functional diversification of MAL genes in strains isolated from bread dough. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, domestication in T. delbrueckii is not primarily driven by alcoholic fermentation but rather by adaptation to dairy and bread-production niches.

The pangenome, a comprehensive genetic pool encompassing all variations within a species, serves as an invaluable tool, unaffected by the confounding factors of intraspecific diversity. This allows for a more nuanced exploration of plant TE evolution. Here, we constructed a pangenome for diploid A-genome cotton using 344 accessions from representative geographical regions, including 223 from China as the main component. We found 511 Mb of non-reference sequences (NRSs) and revealed the presence of 5479 previously undiscovered protein-coding genes. Our comprehensive approach enabled us to decipher the genetic underpinnings of the distinct geographic distributions of cotton. Notably, we identified 3301 presence-absence variations (PAVs) that are closely tied to gene expression patterns within the pangenome, among which 2342 novel expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) were found residing in NRSs. Our investigation also unveiled contrasting patterns of transposon proliferation between diploid and tetraploid cotton, with long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons exhibiting a synchronized surge in polyploids. Furthermore, the invasion of LTR retrotransposons from the A subgenome to the D subgenome triggered a substantial expansion of the latter following polyploidization. In addition, we found that TE insertions were responsible for the loss of 36.2% of species-specific genes, as well as the generation of entirely new species-specific genes.

We review the role of SVs in shaping phenotypes in avian model systems, and identify some general patterns in SV type, length and their associated traits. We found that most of the avian SVs so far identified are short indels in chickens, which are frequently associated with changes in body weight and plumage colouration. Overall, we found that relatively short SVs are more frequently detected, likely due to a combination of their prevalence compared to large SVs, and a detection bias, stemming primarily from the widespread use of short-read sequencing and associated analytical methods. SVs most commonly involve non-coding regions, especially introns, and when patterns of inheritance were reported, SVs associated primarily with dominant discrete traits. We summarise several examples of phenotypic convergence across different species, mediated by different SVs in the same or different genes and different types of changes in the same gene that can lead to various phenotypes. Complex rearrangements and supergenes, which can simultaneously affect and link several genes, tend to have pleiotropic phenotypic effects. Additionally, SVs commonly co-occur with single-nucleotide polymorphisms, highlighting the need to consider all types of genetic changes to understand the basis of phenotypic traits. We end by summarising expectations for when long-read technologies become commonly implemented in non-model birds, likely leading to an increase in SV discovery and characterisation.

Although there has been some progress in the phylogeny of Chrysosplenium over the years, the phylogenetic position of some species is still controversial. In this study, we assembled chloroplast genomes (cp genomes) of 34 Chrysosplenium species and performed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses in combination with other cp genomes of previously known Chrysosplenium species, for a total of 44 Chrysosplenium species. The comparative analyses revealed that cp genomes of Chrysosplenium species were more conserved in terms of genome structure, gene content and arrangement, SSRs, and codon preference, but differ in genome size and SC/IR boundaries. Phylogenetic analysis showed that cp genomes effectively improved the phylogenetic support and resolution of Chrysosplenium species and strongly supported Chrysosplenium species as a monophyletic taxon and divided into three branches. The results also showed that the sections of Alternifolia and Oppositifolia were not monophyletic with each other, and that C. microspermum was not clustered with other Chrysosplenium species with alternate leaves, but with C. sedakowii into separate branches. In addition, we identified 10 mutational hotspot regions that could serve as potential DNA barcodes for Chrysosplenium species identification. In contrast to Peltoboykinia, the clpP and ycf2 genes of Chrysosplenium were subjected to positive selection and had multiple significant positive selection sites. We further detected a significant positive selection site on the petG gene between the two sections of Chrysosplenium.

Established computational tools are able to investigate the genetic content of isolates for which a complete genomic sequence is available. However, there is a plethora of incomplete genomes that are available on public resources, which only a few tools may analyze. Incomplete means that the process for reconstructing their genomic sequence is not complete, and only fragments of their sequence are currently available.

Imazethapyr, a widely utilized imidazolinone herbicide, has a long-lasting presence in the soil-plant system and can induce toxicity in non-target plants. However, the effects of imazethapyr on mineral nutrient homeostasis remain poorly comprehended. In this study, Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to concentrations of 4 and 10 μg/L imazethapyr showed noticeable reductions in shoot development and displayed a distinct dark purple color, which is commonly associated with phosphorus (P) deficiency in crops. Additionally, the total P content in both the shoots and roots of Arabidopsis significantly decreased following imazethapyr treatment when compared to the control groups. Through the complementary use of physiological and molecular analyses, we discovered that imazethapyr hinders the abundance and functionality of inorganic phosphorus (Pi) transporters and acid phosphatase. Furthermore, imazethapyr impairs the plant's Pi-deficiency adaptation strategies, such as inhibiting Pi transporter activities and impeding root hair development, which ultimately exacerbate P starvation.

It is also unclear how many of these genes are widely shared within the clade. Using one of the most extensively characterized genera, Coccolithovirus, as a case study, we combined pangenome analysis, multiple functional annotation tools, AlphaFold structural modeling, and literature analysis to compare the core and accessory pangenome and assess support for novel functional predictions. We determined that the Coccolithovirus pangenome shares 30% of its genes with all 14 strains, making up the core. Notably, 34% of its genes were found in at most three strains. Core genes were enriched in early expression based on a transcriptomic dataset of Coccolithovirus EhV-201 algal infection, were more likely to be similar to host proteins than the non-core set, and were more likely to be involved in vital functions such as replication, recombination, and repair. In addition, we generated and collated annotations for the EhV representative EhV-86 from 12 different annotation sources, building up information for 142 previously hypothetical and putative membrane proteins.

Fifty-one unique C. ureolyticus isolates were identified between January 2010 and August 2022, mostly originating from abscesses and blood cultures. To clarify the taxonomic relationships between isolates and to attribute specific genes with different clinical manifestations, we sequenced 19 available isolates from a variety of clinical specimen types and conducted a pangenomic analysis with publicly available C. ureolyticus genomes.

Numerous tools exist to annotate genes, gene clusters, mobile genetic elements, and other diverse features. However, these tools and pipelines can be difficult to install and run, be specialized for a particular element or feature, or lack annotations for larger elements that provide important genomic context. Integrating results across analyses is also important for understanding gene function. To address these challenges, we present the Beav annotation pipeline. Beav is a command-line tool that automates the annotation of bacterial genome sequences, mobile genetic elements, molecular systems and gene clusters, key regulatory features, and other elements. Beav uses existing tools in addition to custom models, scripts, and databases to annotate diverse elements, systems, and sequence features. Custom databases for plant-associated microbes are incorporated to improve annotation of key virulence and symbiosis genes in agriculturally important pathogens and mutualists. Beav includes an optional Agrobacterium-specific pipeline that identifies and classifies oncogenic plasmids and annotates plasmid-specific features. Following the completion of all analyses, annotations are consolidated to produce a single comprehensive output. Finally, Beav generates publication-quality genome and plasmid maps. Beav is on Bioconda and is available for download at https://github.com/weisberglab/beav. Annotation of genome features, such as the presence of genes and their predicted function, or larger loci encoding secretion systems or biosynthetic gene clusters, is necessary for understanding the functions encoded by an organism. Genomes can also host diverse mobile genetic elements, such as integrative and conjugative elements and/or phages, that are often not annotated by existing pipelines. These elements can horizontally mobilize genes encoding for virulence, antimicrobial resistance, or other adaptive functions and alter the phenotype of an organism. We developed a software pipeline, called Beav, that combines new and existing tools for the comprehensive annotation of these and other major features. Existing pipelines often misannotate loci important for virulence or mutualism in plant-associated bacteria. Beav includes custom databases and optional workflows for the improved annotation of plant-associated bacteria. Beav is designed to be easy to install and run, making comprehensive genome annotation broadly available to the research community.",mSphere,Q2,39037262,基因组学；植物-微生物互作；农杆菌；注释；可移动遗传元件,mSphere,2024-07-22,10.1128/msphere.00209-24,//github.com/weisberglab/beav下载。注释基因组特征（如基因的存在及其预测功能，或编码分泌系统或生物合成基因簇的大片段）对于理解生物体所编码的功能是必要的。基因组还可以携带各种移动遗传元件，例如整合型和接合型元件以及/或噬菌体，而这些通常未被现有流程注释。这些元件可以通过水平转移编码毒力、抗微生物耐药性或其他适应性功能的基因，并改变生物体的表型。我们开发了一种名为Beav的软件流程，结合新旧工具对这些及其他主要特征进行全面注释。现有流程常常错误注释植物相关细菌中与毒力或共生相关的位点。Beav包含自定义数据库和可选工作流，以改善植物相关细菌的注释质量。Beav的设计易于安装和运行，使全面的基因组注释广泛应用于研究社区。

Certain fungal pathogens colonize various body cavities, leading to life-threatening bloodstream infections. However, the identification and characterization of fungal isolates in laboratories remain a significant diagnostic challenge in medicine and public health. Whole-genome sequencing provides an unbiased and uniform identification pipeline for fungal pathogens but most bioinformatic analysis pipelines focus on prokaryotic species. To this end, TheiaEuk_Illumina_PE_PHB (TheiaEuk) was designed to focus on genomic analysis specialized to fungal pathogens. TheiaEuk was designed using containerized components and written in the workflow description language (WDL) to facilitate deployment on the cloud-based open bioinformatics platform Terra. This species-agnostic workflow enables the analysis of fungal genomes without requiring coding, thereby reducing the entry barrier for laboratory scientists. To demonstrate the usefulness of this pipeline, an ongoing outbreak of C. auris in southern Nevada was investigated. We performed whole-genome sequence analysis of 752 new C. auris isolates from this outbreak. Furthermore, TheiaEuk was utilized to observe the accumulation of mutations in the FKS1 gene over the course of the outbreak, highlighting the utility of TheiaEuk as a monitor of emerging public health threats when combined with whole-genome sequencing surveillance of fungal pathogens. A primary result of this work is a curated fungal database containing 5,667 unique genomes representing 245 species. TheiaEuk also incorporates taxon-specific submodules for specific species, including clade-typing for Candida auris (C. auris).

Ammonium is oxidized to nitrate by nitrifiers, but roots can release biological nitrification inhibitors (BNIs). Under what conditions does root-exudation of BNIs facilitate nitrogen N uptake and reduce pollution by N loss to the environment? We modeled the spatial-temporal dynamics of nitrifiers, ammonium, nitrate, and BNIs around a root and simulated root N uptake and net rhizosphere N loss over the plant's life cycle. We determined the sensitivity of N uptake and loss to variations in the parameter values, testing a broad range of soil-plant-microbial conditions, including concentrations, diffusion, sorption, nitrification, population growth, and uptake kinetics. An increase in BNI exudation reduces net N loss and, under most conditions, increases plant N uptake. BNIs decrease uptake in the case of (1) low ammonium concentrations, (2) high ammonium adsorption to the soil, (3) rapid nitrate- or slow ammonium uptake by the plant, and (4) a slowly growing or (5) fast-declining nitrifier population. Bactericidal inhibitors facilitate uptake more than bacteriostatic ones. Some nitrification, however, is necessary to maximize uptake by both ammonium and nitrate transporter systems. An increase in BNI exudation should be co-selected with improved ammonium uptake. BNIs can reduce N uptake, which may explain why not all species exude BNIs but have a generally positive effect on the environment by increasing rhizosphere N retention.",Scientific reports,Q2,38951138,NUE（氮素利用效率）；氮淋失；细菌；根系分泌物；根际模型,Scientific reports,2024-07-02,10.1038/s41598-024-65247-2,(1) 铵浓度较低；(2) 铵被土壤强烈吸附；(3) 植物快速吸收硝酸盐或缓慢吸收铵；(4) 硝化细菌种群增长缓慢或快速下降。杀菌型抑制剂比抑菌型抑制剂更能促进氮吸收。然而，为了最大化铵和硝酸盐转运系统的氮吸收，一定程度的硝化作用是必要的。因此，BNIs的分泌应与改善铵吸收协同选择。尽管BNIs可能会降低氮吸收，但它们通常通过增加根际氮滞留而对环境产生积极影响，这也是并非所有物种都分泌BNIs的原因之一。

However, these methods have limitations, potentially resulting in imprecise predictions owing to incomplete coverage of AMR mechanisms and genetic variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a pan-genome-based machine learning approach to advance our understanding of AMR gene repertoires and uncover possible feature sets for precise AMR classification. By building compacted de Brujin graphs (cDBGs) from thousands of genomes and collecting the presence/absence patterns of unique sequences (unitigs) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we determined that using machine learning models on unitig-centered pan-genomes showed significant promise for accurately predicting the antibiotic resistance or susceptibility of microbial strains. Applying a feature-selection-based machine learning algorithm led to satisfactory predictive performance for the training dataset (with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of > 0.929) and an independent validation dataset (AUC, approximately 0.77). Furthermore, the selected unitigs revealed previously unidentified resistance genes, allowing for the expansion of the resistance gene repertoire to those that have not previously been described in the literature on antibiotic resistance. These results demonstrate that our proposed unitig-based pan-genome feature set was effective in constructing machine learning predictors that could accurately identify AMR pathogens.

Genome disorder prediction is an important issue in biomedical research. Genome disorders cause multivariate diseases such as cancer, dementia, diabetes, Leigh syndrome, etc. Existing machine and deep learning-based methods were introduced to forecast genome disorders. However, the genome prediction outcomes were not sufficient. To address this issue, propose a new method called Quadratic Feynman Polynomial Interpolated and Vector Nearest Centroid-based (QFPI-VNC) for acutely predicting the genome disorder with improved sensitivity and specificity. First, we utilized medical data about children from a public genomes dataset and applied it to Linear Quadratic and Feynman Kac Genome filtering to obtain computationally efficient filtered results. Next, the results are fed to the Concordance Correlated Polynomial Interpolation with the purpose of extracting genome wide data in an accurate manner. Finally, the features extracted are fused and fed to the Support Vector and Nearest Centroid model for genome disorder prediction.

MAIN: The environment influences an organism's genome through ambient factors in the biosphere (e.g. climate and UV radiation), as well as the agents it comes into contact with, i.e. the epigenetic and mutagenic effects of inanimate chemicals and pollution, and pathogenic organisms. Emerging scientific consensus is that social determinants of health, environmental conditions and genetic factors work together to influence the risk of many complex illnesses. That paradigm can also explain the environmental and ecological determinants of health as factors that underlie the (un)healthy ecosystems on which communities rely. We suggest that The Ecological Genome Project is an aspirational opportunity to explore connections between the human genome and nature. We propose consolidating a view of Ecogenomics to provide a blueprint to respond to the environmental challenges that societies face. This can only be achieved by interdisciplinary engagement between genomics and the broad field of ecology and related practice of conservation. In this respect, the One Health approach is a model for environmental orientated work. The idea of Ecogenomics-a term that has been used to relate to a scientific field of ecological genomics-becomes the conceptual study of genomes within the social and natural environment. The HUGO Committee on Ethics, Law and Society (CELS) recommends that an interdisciplinary One Health approach should be adopted in genomic sciences to promote ethical environmentalism.

The results from comparative and functional genomic analyses regarding the phylogenomic and the clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COGs) analyses indicated that SMC256T is most closely related to Kutzneria sp. 744, Kutzneria kofuensis, Kutzneria sp. CA-103260 and Kutzneria buriramensis. Furthermore, a total of 322 BGCs were also detected and showed diversity among the Kutzneria genomes. Out of which, 38 clusters showing the best hit to the most known BGCs were predicted in the SMC256Tgenome. We observed that six clusters responsible for biosynthesis of antimicrobials/antitumor metabolites were strain-specific in Kutzneria chonburiensis. These putative metabolites include virginiamycin S1, lysolipin I, esmeraldin, rakicidin, aclacinomycin and streptoseomycin. Based on these findings, the genome of Kutzneria chonburiensis contains distinct and unidentified BGCs different from other members of the genus, and the use of integrative genomic-based approach would be a useful alternative effort to target, isolate and identify putative and undiscovered secondary metabolites suspected to have new and/or specific bioactivity in the Kutzneria.",Scientific reports,Q2,37258607,Kutzneria chonburiensis; 二级代谢物; 生物合成基因簇; 基因组比较; 系统发育基因组学; 蛋白质直系同源群; 抗菌化合物; 分子生物学; 生物信息学,Scientific reports,2023-06-01,10.1038/s41598-023-36039-x,放线菌是一类富含具有生物活性次级代谢产物多样性的细菌。库茨内里亚（Kutzneria）属于假诺卡氏菌科，是一种稀有的放线菌，其基因组中含有大量次级代谢物生物合成基因簇（BGCs），是天然产物的重要来源之一，值得优先研究。目前，库茨内里亚庞布里恩西斯SMC256^T是该属最新的模式菌株，但其全基因组序列尚未报道。因此，我们首次报告了SMC256^T的新完整基因组序列（基因组大小为10.4 Mbp），并对其进行了基因组注释和与其他已公开的库茨内里亚物种的特征比较。系统发育基因组学分析和直系同源蛋白群（COGs）分析结果表明，SMC256^T与库茨内里亚sp. 744、库茨内里亚甲府菌、库茨内里亚sp. CA-103260以及库茨内里亚武里喃森西斯亲缘关系最近。此外，在库茨内里亚基因组中检测到总计322个BGCs，并显示出多样性。其中，在SMC256^T基因组中共预测出38个与已知BGCs高度匹配的簇。我们观察到，库茨内里亚庞布里恩西斯中六个负责抗微生物/抗肿瘤代谢物生物合成的簇为菌株特异性。这些潜在的代谢产物包括virginiamycin S1、lysolipin I、esmeraldin、rakicidin、aclacinomycin和streptoseomycin。基于以上发现，库茨内里亚庞布里恩西斯的基因组含有与其他属成员不同的独特且未鉴定的BGCs，采用整合基因组学方法可能是靶向、分离和鉴定库茨内里亚中潜在的和未被发现的具有新和/或特定生物活性的次级代谢物的一种有用的替代方法。

Due to advancements in sequencing and computational technology, it has become feasible to sequence the entire genome of numerous individuals of a single species at a reasonable cost. Pangenomes have been constructed for many major diploid crops, including rice, maize, soybean, sorghum, pearl millet, peas, sunflower, grapes, and mustards. However, pangenomes for polyploid species are relatively scarce and are available in only few crops including wheat, cotton, rapeseed, and potatoes. In this review, we explore the various methods used in crop pangenome development, discussing the challenges and implications of these techniques based on insights from published pangenome studies. We offer a systematic guide and discuss the tools available for constructing a pangenome and conducting downstream analyses. Alfalfa, a highly heterozygous, cross pollinated and autotetraploid forage crop species, is used as an example to discuss the concerns and challenges offered by polyploid crop species. We conducted a comparative analysis using linear and graph-based methods by constructing an alfalfa graph pangenome using three publicly available genome assemblies. To illustrate the intricacies captured by pangenome graphs for a complex crop genome, we used five different gene sequences and aligned them against the three graph-based pangenomes. The comparison of the three graph pangenome methods reveals notable variations in the genomic variation captured by each pipeline. Pangenome resources are proving invaluable by offering insights into core and dispensable genes, novel gene discovery, and genome-wide patterns of variation. Developing user-friendly online portals for linear pangenome visualization has made these resources accessible to the broader scientific and breeding community. However, challenges remain with graph-based pangenomes including compatibility with other tools, extraction of sequence for regions of interest, and visualization of genetic variation captured in pangenome graphs.

Due to multiple complex adaptive and neutral forces which impose evolutionary pressures on genomes, there is a huge variability of genomic features. However, their variability and the extent to which genomic content determines the distribution of recovered loci in reduced representation sequencing studies is largely unexplored. Here, by using 80 genome assemblies, we observed that whereas plants primarily increase their genome size by expanding their intergenic regions, animals expand both intergenic and intronic regions, although the expansion patterns differ between deuterostomes and protostomes. Loci mapping in introns, exons, and intergenic categories obtained by in silico digestion using 2b-enzymes are positively correlated with the percentage of these regions in the corresponding genomes, suggesting that loci distribution mostly mirrors genomic architecture of the selected taxon. However, exonic regions showed a significant enrichment of loci in all groups regardless of the used enzyme. Moreover, when using selective adaptors to obtain a secondarily reduced loci dataset, the percentage and distribution of retained loci also varied. Adaptors with G/C terminals recovered a lower percentage of selected loci, with a further enrichment of exonic regions, while adaptors with A/T terminals retained a higher percentage of loci and slightly selected more intronic regions than expected. Our results highlight how genome composition, genome GC content, RAD enzyme choice and use of base-selective adaptors influence reduced genome representation techniques.

However, marker-assisted selection has proven its potential for improving qualitative traits with large effects regulated by one to few genes. Its contribution to the improvement of the quantitative traits regulated by a number of small-effect genes is modest. In this context, genomic selection (GS) has been regarded as the most promising method for genetically enhancing complicated features that are regulated by several genes, each of which has minor effects. By examining a population's phenotypes and high-density marker scores, genomic selection can forecast the breeding potential of individual lines. The fact that GS uses all marker data in the prediction model prevents skewed marker effect estimations and maximizes the amount of variation caused by small-effect QTL. It has the ability to speed up the breeding cycle and as a consequence of which superior genotypes are selected rapidly. Developing the best GS models while taking into account non-additive effects, genotype-by-environment interaction, and cost-effectiveness will enable the widespread implementation of GS in plants.

Among the identified genomic SSRs across the three species, short repeat sequences were more abundant, while long repeat sequences constituted a smaller proportion. Additionally, the predominant repeat motifs in the SSRs of the three Broussonetia species were composed of 'A' and 'T' repeats. Using B. papyrifera genome as a reference, 4,419 common SSRs were identified among these three species, while 2,048 SSRs were specific to B. kaempferi, and 4,285 SSRs were specific to B. monoica. Distribution analysis indicated a notable similarity in the distribution patterns of SSRs across the pseudochromosomes of these three species. Furthermore, of the identified SSRs, 28%, 31%, and 24% were mapped to genes in B. papyrifera, B. kaempferi, and B. monoica, respectively.

Genome research on dinoflagellates has lagged due to their immense genome sizes in most species (~ 1-250 Gbp). Nevertheless, the last decade marked a fruitful era of dinoflagellate genomics, with 27 genomes sequenced and many insights attained. This review aims to synthesize information from these genomes, along with other omic data, to reflect on where we are now in understanding dinoflagellates and where we are heading in the future. The most notable insights from the decade-long genomics work include: (1) dinoflagellate genomes have been expanded in multiple times independently, probably by a combination of rampant retroposition, accumulation of repetitive DNA, and genome duplication; (2) Symbiodiniacean genomes are highly divergent, but share about 3,445 core unigenes concentrated in 219 KEGG pathways; (3) Most dinoflagellate genes are encoded unidirectionally and are not intron-poor; (4) The dinoflagellate nucleus has undergone extreme evolutionary changes, including complete or nearly complete loss of nucleosome and histone H1, and acquisition of dinoflagellate viral nuclear protein (DVNP); (5) Major basic nuclear protein (MBNP), histone-like protein (HLP), and bacterial HU-like protein (HCc) belong to the same protein family, and MBNP can be the unifying name; (6) Dinoflagellate gene expression is regulated by poorly understood mechanisms, but microRNA and other epigenetic mechanisms are likely important; (7) Over 50% of dinoflagellate genes are ""dark"" and their functions remain to be deciphered using functional genetics; (8) Initial insights into the genomic basis of parasitism and mutualism have emerged.

Recent evidence suggests that lncRNAs may also play roles in virulence, such as regulating pathogenicity-associated enzymes and on-host reproductive cycles. Despite the importance of lncRNAs, only a few model fungi have well-documented inventories of lncRNA. In this study, we apply a recent computational pipeline to predict high-confidence lncRNA candidates in Zymoseptoria tritici, an important global pathogen of wheat impacting global food production. We analyse genomic features of lncRNAs and the most likely associated processes through analyses of expression over a host infection cycle. We find that lncRNAs are frequently expressed during early infection, before the switch to necrotrophic growth. They are mostly located in facultative heterochromatic regions, which are known to contain many genes associated with pathogenicity. Furthermore, we find that lncRNAs are frequently co-expressed with genes that may be involved in responding to host defence signals, such as oxidative stress. Finally, we assess pangenome features of lncRNAs using four additional reference-quality genomes. We find evidence that the repertoire of expressed lncRNAs varies substantially between individuals, even though lncRNA loci tend to be shared at the genomic level.

Large genome size may be associated with lower selection efficiency because lower effective population sizes allow fixation of deleterious mutations via genetic drift, increasing genome size and decreasing selection efficiency. Because of a hypothesized negative relationship between genome size and recombination rate per base pair, increased genome size could also increase the effect of linked selection in the genome, decreasing the efficiency with which natural selection can fix or remove mutations. We used a transcriptomic dataset of 15 and a subset of six Neotropical salamander species ranging in genome size from 12 to 87 pg to study the relationship between genome size and efficiency of selection. We estimated dN/dS of salamanders with small and large genomes and tested for relaxation of selection in the larger genomes. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find a significant relationship between genome size and selection efficiency or strong evidence for higher dN/dS values in species with larger genomes for either species set. We also found little evidence for relaxation of selection in species with larger genomes.

Using synthetic nematicides to control plant-parasitic nematodes has resulted in broad-spectrum toxicity to the environment. Plant-derived secondary metabolites have recently emerged as viable options that provide effective, greener, and renewable routes for managing plant-parasitic nematodes in various cropping systems. However, limited comprehensive information on plant-derived secondary metabolites sources, chemical structures, and nematicidal activities is available. This study aims to compile and analyze data on plant-based secondary metabolites with nematicidal properties collected over the last two decades. In this review, we identified 262 plant-based metabolites with nematicidal activities that were isolated from 35 plant families and 65 plant species. Alkaloids, terpenoids, saponins, flavonoids, coumarins, thiophenes, and annonaceous acetogenins were among the most studied compounds.

Multiple different methods are currently used to cluster together closely related genomes, potentially leading to inconsistency between studies. Here, we use a global dataset of 26 306 Streptococcus pneumoniae genomes to compare four clustering methods: gene-by-gene seven-locus MLST, core genome MLST (cgMLST)-based hierarchical clustering (HierCC) assignments, life identification number (LIN) barcoding and k-mer-based PopPUNK clustering (known as GPSCs in this species). We compare the clustering results with phylogenetic and pan-genome analyses to assess their relationship with genome diversity and evolution, as we would expect a good clustering method to form a single monophyletic cluster that has high within-cluster similarity of genomic content. We show that the four methods are generally able to accurately reflect the population structure based on these metrics and that the methods were broadly consistent with each other. We investigated further to study the discrepancies in clusters. The greatest concordance was seen between LIN barcoding and HierCC (adjusted mutual information score=0.950), which was expected given that both methods utilize cgMLST, but have different methods for defining an individual cluster and different core genome schema. However, the existence of differences between the two methods shows that the selection of a core genome schema can introduce inconsistencies between studies. GPSC and HierCC assignments were also highly concordant (AMI=0.946), showing that k-mer-based methods which use the whole genome and do not require the careful selection of a core genome schema are just as effective at representing the population structure. Additionally, where there were differences in clustering between these methods, this could be explained by differences in the accessory genome that were not identified in cgMLST. We conclude that for S. pneumoniae, standardized and stable nomenclature is important as the number of genomes available expands. Furthermore, the research community should transition away from seven-locus MLST, whilst cgMLST, GPSC and LIN assignments should be used more widely. However, to allow for easy comparison between studies and to make previous literature relevant, the reporting of multiple clustering names should be standardized within the research.",Microbial genomics,Q2,39196267,肺炎链球菌；群体结构；全基因组测序；肺炎链球菌基因组学；多位点序列分型；流行病学,Microbial genomics,2024-08-28,10.1099/mgen.0.001278,基于基因的七位点多位点序列分型（gene-by-gene seven-locus MLST）、基于核心基因组多位点序列分型（cgMLST）的分层聚类（HierCC分配）、生命识别编号（LIN）条形码以及基于k-mer的PopPUNK聚类（在该物种中称为GPSC）。我们通过与系统发育和泛基因组分析的结果进行比较，评估这些方法与其所反映的基因组多样性和进化的关系，因为我们期望一种好的聚类方法能够形成一个单系的聚类群，且群内基因组内容具有高度相似性。结果显示，这四种方法通常能够准确反映基于这些指标的种群结构，并且彼此之间大体上具有一致性。我们进一步研究了聚类之间的差异。LIN条形码与HierCC之间的最大一致性（调整后的互信息得分=0.950），这是可以预期的，因为这两种方法都利用了cgMLST，但定义个体聚类的方法和核心基因组模式不同。然而，两种方法之间存在的差异表明，核心基因组模式的选择可以在研究之间引入不一致性。GPSC和HierCC的分配也高度一致（AMI=0.946），表明使用全基因组的基于k-mer的方法不需要仔细选择核心基因组模式，同样能够有效地表示种群结构。此外，在这些方法之间出现的聚类差异可以通过cgMLST未识别的辅助基因组差异来解释。我们得出结论，对于肺炎链球菌而言，随着可用基因组数量的增加，标准化和稳定的命名法非常重要。此外，研究界应逐步淘汰七位点MLST，而广泛采用cgMLST、GPSC和LIN分配。然而，为了便于研究之间的比较并使先前的文献相关，应在研究中对多种聚类名称的报告进行标准化。

Recent advancements, such as GeneSeek's low- and high-density SNP panels, have aimed to reduce ascertainment bias and include key SNPs for Zebu populations by providing breed-specific panels. These panels have been instrumental in identifying genomic regions associated with economically important traits in Nellore cattle. Studies show that tailored SNP arrays and breed-specific reference genomes can enhance genetic diversity assessment and improve genomic predictions, supporting more effective breeding programs for Zebu cattle. Improved SNP arrays and breed-specific reference genomes are crucial for accurate genomic selection in Zebu cattle. Future efforts should prioritize expanding de novo genome assemblies, reducing ascertainment bias, and developing cost-effective genotyping solutions tailored to Zebu populations. Targeted genomic tools will ultimately enable more efficient breeding practices and enhance genomic selection for economically important traits in B. t. indicus cattle.",Genes,Q2,39766762,遗传改良；品种特异性面板；泽西牛,Genes,2025-01-08,10.3390/genes15121495,单核苷酸多态性（SNP）芯片和参考基因组组装的进步显著改变了牛的基因组学研究，特别是在普通牛（Bos taurus indicus，即瘤牛）中。许多商业化的SNP芯片最初是为普通牛（Bos taurus taurus）设计的，导致了选择偏差，并排除了许多对瘤牛群体至关重要的SNP。本文综述了针对瘤牛群体开发的SNP芯片和参考基因组的研究进展及其对基因组选择和育种效率的影响。我们回顾了与瘤牛相关的SNP芯片、参考基因组组装以及SNP分型技术的相关文献，重点关注专为瘤牛品种设计的SNP芯片，评估其在基因组评估中的贡献，并识别预测准确性方面的局限性。近年来，如GeneSeek公司推出的低密度和高密度SNP面板等新进展，通过提供品种特异性面板，旨在减少选择偏差并包含关键的瘤牛SNP。这些面板在鉴定与重要经济性状相关的基因组区域方面发挥了重要作用，尤其是在纳拉伊牛（Nellore cattle）中。研究表明，定制的SNP芯片和品种特异性参考基因组可以提高遗传多样性评估的准确性，并改善基因组预测，从而支持更有效的瘤牛育种计划。改进的SNP芯片和品种特异性参考基因组对于瘤牛的精确基因组选择至关重要。未来的研究应优先考虑扩展从头组装基因组、减少选择偏差，并开发针对瘤牛群体的成本效益高的基因分型解决方案。针对性的基因组工具最终将促进更高效的育种实践，并增强对瘤牛（B. t. indicus）重要经济性状的基因组选择。

In addition, Paracoccus is taxonomically, metabolically and regarding lifestyle highly diverse. Until now, little is known on how Paracoccus can adapt to such a range of different ecological niches and lifestyles. In the present study, the genus Paracoccus was phylogenomically analyzed (n = 160) and revisited, allowing species level classification of 16 so far unclassified Paracoccus sp. strains and detection of five misclassifications. Moreover, we performed pan-genome analysis of Paracoccus-type strains, isolated from a variety of ecological niches, including different soils, tidal flat sediment, host association such as the bluespotted cornetfish, Bugula plumosa, and the reef-building coral Stylophora pistillata to elucidate either i) the importance of lifestyle and adaptation potential, and ii) the role of the genomic equipment and niche adaptation potential. Six complete genomes were de novo hybrid assembled using a combination of short and long-read technologies. These Paracoccus genomes increase the number of completely closed high-quality genomes of type strains from 15 to 21. Pan-genome analysis revealed an open pan-genome composed of 13,819 genes with a minimal chromosomal core (8.84%) highlighting the genomic adaptation potential and the huge impact of extra-chromosomal elements. All genomes are shaped by the acquisition of various mobile genetic elements including genomic islands, prophages, transposases, and insertion sequences emphasizing their genomic plasticity. In terms of lifestyle, each mobile genetic elements should be evaluated separately with respect to the ecological context. Free-living genomes, in contrast to host-associated, tend to comprise (1) larger genomes, or the highest number of extra-chromosomal elements, (2) higher number of genomic islands and insertion sequence elements, and (3) a lower number of intact prophage regions. Regarding lifestyle adaptations, free-living genomes share genes linked to genetic exchange via T4SS, especially relevant for Paracoccus, known for their numerous extrachromosomal elements, enabling adaptation to dynamic environments. Conversely, host-associated genomes feature diverse genes involved in molecule transport, cell wall modification, attachment, stress protection, DNA repair, carbon, and nitrogen metabolism.

Detection methods based on oocyst morphology, staining, and molecular testing have been developed. However, the current MLST panel offers an opportunity for enhancement, as amplification of all molecular markers remains unfeasible in the majority of samples. This study aims to address this challenge by evaluating two approaches for analyzing the genetic diversity of C. cayetanensis and identifying reliable markers for subtyping: core homologous genes and mitochondrial genome analysis. A pangenome was constructed using 36 complete genomes of C. cayetanensis, and a haplotype network and phylogenetic analysis were conducted using 33 mitochondrial genomes. Through the analysis of the pangenome, 47 potential markers were identified, emphasizing the need for more sequence data to achieve comprehensive characterization. Additionally, the analysis of mitochondrial genomes revealed 19 single-nucleotide variations that can serve as characteristic markers for subtyping this parasite.

However, the absence of standardized naming conventions for genome assemblies and annotations across datasets creates substantial challenges. Inconsistent naming hinders the identification of correct assemblies, complicates the integration of bioinformatics pipelines, and makes it difficult to link assemblies across multiple resources. To address this, we developed a specification for standardizing the naming of reference genome assemblies, to improve consistency across datasets and facilitate interoperability. This specification was created with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) practices in mind, ensuring that reference assemblies are easier to locate, access, and reuse across research communities. Additionally, it has been designed to comply with primary genomic data repositories, including members of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration consortium, ensuring compatibility with widely used databases. While initially tailored to the agricultural genomics community, the specification is adaptable for use across different taxa. Widespread adoption of this standardized nomenclature would streamline assembly management, better enable cross-species analyses, and improve the reproducibility of research. It would also enhance natural language processing applications that depend on consistent reference assembly names in genomic literature, promoting greater integration and automated analysis of genomic data.

We analyzed and described the features of the complete cp genome of C. aquatica and conducted comparative analysis with the cp genomes of closely related taxa. The cp genome was 144,503 bp in length and exhibited the typical quadripartite structure, consisting of a large single-copy region (LSC; 77,993 bp), a small single-copy region (SSC; 16,784 bp), and two inverted repeats (24,863 bp). The cp genome of C. aquatica comprised 113 unique genes, including 79 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 30 tRNAs, and 4 rRNA genes. Comparative genomic analysis of 13 other Crassula species and six outgroups demonstrated highly conserved gene content and order among Crassula species. However, notable differences were observed, including the complete loss of the rpoC1 intron in C. aquatica and several closely related species, which may serve as a synapomorphic trait supporting the monophyly of the subgenus Disporocarpa. We analyzed the nucleotide diversity among 14 Crassula cp genomes and identified five highly variable regions (pi > 0.08) in the IGS regions.

These estimations often underestimate the evolutionary distance for genomes that have substantially evolved from each other, and advanced statistical methods can be used to improve accuracy. Several statistical estimators have been developed, under various evolutionary models, of which the most complete one, INFER, takes into account different degrees of genome fragility.

Within geckos (infraorder Gekkota), a species-rich clade of lizards, chromosome-level genomes are exceptionally sparse representing only two of the seven extant families. Using the latest advances in genome sequencing and assembly methods, we generated one of the highest-quality squamate genomes to date for the leopard gecko, Eublepharis macularius (Eublepharidae). We compared this assembly to the previous, short-read only, E. macularius reference genome published in 2016 and examined potential factors within the assembly influencing contiguity of genome assemblies using PacBio HiFi data. Briefly, the read N50 of the PacBio HiFi reads generated for this study was equal to the contig N50 of the previous E. macularius reference genome at 20.4 kilobases. The HiFi reads were assembled into a total of 132 contigs, which was further scaffolded using HiC data into 75 total sequences representing all 19 chromosomes. We identified 9 of the 19 chromosomal scaffolds were assembled as a near-single contig, whereas the other 10 chromosomes were each scaffolded together from multiple contigs. We qualitatively identified that the percent repeat content within a chromosome broadly affects its assembly contiguity prior to scaffolding.

Our objective was to evaluate the site-specialization of Gemella species among various habitats within the mouth by combining pangenomics and metagenomics. With pangenomics, we identified genome relationships and categorized genes as core and accessory to each species. With metagenomics, we identified the primary oral habitat of individual genomes. Our results establish that the genomes of three species, G. haemolysans, G. sanguinis and G. morbillorum, are abundant and prevalent in human mouths at different oral sites: G. haemolysans on buccal mucosa and keratinized gingiva; G. sanguinis on tongue dorsum, throat, and tonsils; and G. morbillorum in dental plaque. The gene-level basis of site-specificity was investigated by identifying genes that were core to Gemella genomes at a specific oral site but absent from other Gemella genomes. The riboflavin biosynthesis pathway was present in G. haemolysans genomes associated with buccal mucosa but absent from the rest of the genomes.

As an important genetic resource, C. mollissima is vital in enhancing edible chestnut varieties and offers significant insights into the origin and evolution of chestnut species. While the chloroplast genome of C. mollissima has been sequenced, its mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) remains largely uncharted. In this study, we have characterized the C. mollissima mitogenome, assembling it utilizing reads from both BGI and Nanopore sequencing platforms, and conducted a comparative analysis with the mitochondrial genomes of closely related species. The mitogenome of C. mollissima manifests a polycyclic structure consisting of two circular molecules measuring 363,232 bp and 24,806 bp, respectively. This genome encompasses 35 unique protein-coding genes, 19 tRNA genes, and three rRNA genes. A total of 139 SSRs were identified throughout the entire C. mollissima mitogenome. Furthermore, the combined length of homologous fragments between the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes was 5766 bp, constituting 1.49% of the mitogenome. We also predicted 484 RNA editing sites in C. mollissima, demonstrating C-to-U RNA editing. Phylogenetic analysis of related species' mitogenomes showed that C. mollissima was closely related to Lithocarpus litseifolius (Hance) Chun and Quercus acutissima Carruth.

However, the identification of species-specific fixed genetic variants requires the analysis of genomes from multiple individuals. Moreover, the long-term scale of adaptive evolution coupled with the short-term nature of traditional time series data has made it difficult to assess when different adaptations evolved. Here, we analyze 23 woolly mammoth genomes, including one of the oldest known specimens at 700,000 years old, to identify fixed derived non-synonymous mutations unique to the species and to obtain estimates of when these mutations evolved. We find that at the time of its origin, the woolly mammoth had already acquired a broad spectrum of positively selected genes, including ones associated with hair and skin development, fat storage and metabolism, and immune system function. Our results also suggest that these phenotypes continued to evolve during the last 700,000 years, but through positive selection on different sets of genes.

It combines the genetic information of all the genomes sampled, resulting in a large and diverse range of genetic material. Pangenomic analysis offers several advantages compared to traditional genomic research. For example, a pangenome is not bound by the physical constraints of a single genome, so it can capture more genetic variability. Thanks to the introduction of the concept of pangenome, it is possible to use exceedingly detailed sequence data to study the evolutionary history of two different species, or how populations within a species differ genetically. In the wake of the Human Pangenome Project, this review aims at discussing the advantages of the pangenome around human genetic variation, which are then framed around how pangenomic data can inform population genetics, phylogenetics, and public health policy by providing insights into the genetic basis of diseases or determining personalized treatments, targeting the specific genetic profile of an individual.

Bacteroides fragilis is a Gram-negative anaerobe that is a member of the human gastrointestinal microbiota and is frequently found as an extra-intestinal opportunistic pathogen. B. fragilis comprises two distinct groups - divisions I and II - characterized by the presence/absence of genes [cepA and ccrA (cfiA), respectively] that confer resistance to β-lactam antibiotics by either serine or metallo-β-lactamase production. No large-scale analyses of publicly available B. fragilis sequence data have been undertaken, and the resistome of the species remains poorly defined.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Reclassification of divisions I and II B. fragilis as two distinct species has been proposed but additional evidence is required.Aims. To investigate the genomic diversity of GenBank B. fragilis genomes and establish the prevalence of division I and II strains among publicly available B. fragilis genomes, and to generate further evidence to demonstrate that B. fragilis division I and II strains represent distinct genomospecies.Methodology. High-quality (n=377) genomes listed as B. fragilis in GenBank were included in pangenome and functional analyses. Genome data were also subject to resistome profiling using The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database.Results. Average nucleotide identity and phylogenetic analyses showed B. fragilis divisions I and II represent distinct species: B. fragilis sensu stricto (n=275 genomes) and B. fragilis A (n=102 genomes; Genome Taxonomy Database designation), respectively. Exploration of the pangenome of B. fragilis sensu stricto and B. fragilis A revealed separation of the two species at the core and accessory gene levels.Conclusion. The findings indicate that B. fragilis A, previously referred to as division II B. fragilis, is an individual species and distinct from B. fragilis sensu stricto. The B. fragilis pangenome analysis supported previous genomic, phylogenetic and resistome screening analyses collectively reinforcing that divisions I and II are two separate species. In addition, it was confirmed that differences in the accessory genes of B. fragilis divisions I and II are primarily associated with carbohydrate metabolism and suggest that differences other than antimicrobial resistance could also be used to distinguish between these two species.",Journal of medical microbiology,Q3,37910167,抗菌耐药性；分类学；拟杆菌科,Journal of theoretical biology,2023-11-01,10.1099/jmm.0.001768,"**摘要**  
**引言**：脆弱拟杆菌（*Bacteroides fragilis*）是一种革兰氏阴性厌氧菌，属于人体胃肠道微生物群的一部分，并常作为肠外机会性病原体被发现。脆弱拟杆菌分为两个不同的组别——第I组和第II组，其特征在于存在或缺失与β-内酰胺类抗生素耐药性相关的基因（分别为*cepA*和*ccrA*（*cfiA*））。目前尚未对公共数据库中可获得的脆弱拟杆菌序列数据进行大规模分析，该物种的抗性组仍定义不清。  
**假设/研究空白**：有提议将第I组和第II组脆弱拟杆菌重新分类为两个独立的物种，但需要更多证据支持这一观点。  
**目的**：本研究旨在调查GenBank中脆弱拟杆菌基因组的基因组多样性，并确定公共数据库中第I组和第II组菌株的流行率，同时生成进一步的证据以证明第I组和第II组脆弱拟杆菌代表了不同的基因组物种。  
**方法**：纳入了GenBank中标记为脆弱拟杆菌的高质量（n=377）基因组进行泛基因组和功能分析。此外，使用《综合抗生素抗性数据库》对基因组数据进行了抗性组谱分析。  
**结果**：平均核苷酸一致性（ANI）和系统发育分析表明，脆弱拟杆菌的第I组和第II组代表了两个不同的物种：严格意义上的脆弱拟杆菌（*B. fragilis* sensu stricto，n=275个基因组）和脆弱拟杆菌A（*B. fragilis* A，n=102个基因组；基因组分类数据库中的名称）。对严格意义上的脆弱拟杆菌和脆弱拟杆菌A的泛基因组探索显示，这两个物种在核心基因和辅助基因水平上均存在分离。  
**结论**：研究结果表明，以前被称为第II组脆弱拟杆菌的脆弱拟杆菌A是一个独立的物种，且不同于严格意义上的脆弱拟杆菌。脆弱拟杆菌的泛基因组分析支持了先前的基因组、系统发育和抗性组筛查分析，共同证实了第I组和第II组是两个独立的物种。此外，还确认了第I组和第II组脆弱拟杆菌的辅助基因差异主要与碳水化合物代谢相关，这表明除了抗菌素耐药性之外，其他差异也可能用于区分这两个物种。"

Ferragina and Fischer [1] observed in 2007 that word-based indexes often use fewer random accesses than character-based indexes, and thus support faster searches. Since DNA lacks natural word-boundaries, however, it is necessary to parse it somehow before applying word-based FM-indexing. In 2022, Deng et al. [2] proposed parsing genomic data by induced suffix sorting, and showed that the resulting word-based FM-indexes support faster counting queries than standard FM-indexes when patterns are a few thousand characters or longer. In this paper we show that using prefix-free parsing-which takes parameters that let us tune the average length of the phrases-instead of induced suffix sorting, gives a significant speedup for patterns of only a few hundred characters.

It has already been successfully applied to various tasks in many research areas. Further advances in DNA sequencing technologies constantly let more and more genomic sequences become available for many species, leading to an increasing attractiveness of pangenomic studies. At the same time, larger datasets also pose new challenges for data structures and algorithms that are needed to handle the data. Efficient methods oftentimes make use of the concept of k-mers.Core detection is a common way of analyzing a pangenome. The pangenome's core is defined as the subset of genomic information shared among all individual members.

However, efficiently aligning sequences to these graphs with complex topology and cycles can be challenging. The seed-chain-extend based alignment algorithms use co-linear chaining as a standard technique to identify a good cluster of exact seed matches that can be combined to form an alignment. Recent works show how the co-linear chaining problem can be efficiently solved for acyclic pangenome graphs by exploiting their small width and how incorporating gap cost in the scoring function improves alignment accuracy. However, it remains open on how to effectively generalize these techniques for general pangenome graphs which contain cycles. Here we present the first practical formulation and an exact algorithm for co-linear chaining on cyclic pangenome graphs. We rigorously prove the correctness and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. We evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm by aligning simulated long reads from the human genome to a cyclic pangenome graph constructed from 95 publicly available haplotype-resolved human genome assemblies. While the existing heuristic-based algorithms are faster, the proposed algorithm provides a significant advantage in terms of accuracy.

Ferragina and Fischer [1] observed in 2007 that word-based indexes often use fewer random accesses than character-based indexes, and thus support faster searches. Since DNA lacks natural word-boundaries, however, it is necessary to parse it somehow before applying word-based FM-indexing. Last year, Deng et al. [2] proposed parsing genomic data by induced suffix sorting, and showed the resulting word-based FM-indexes support faster counting queries than standard FM-indexes when patterns are a few thousand characters or longer. In this paper we show that using prefix-free parsing-which takes parameters that let us tune the average length of the phrases-instead of induced suffix sorting, gives a significant speedup for patterns of only a few hundred characters. We implement our method and demonstrate it is between 3 and 18 times faster than competing methods on queries to GRCh38, and is consistently faster on queries made to 25,000, 50,000 and 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

TB infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis can occur in the lungs, causing pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), or in any other organ of the body, resulting in extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB). There is no consensus on the genetic determinants of this pathogen that may contribute to EPTB. In this study, we constructed the M. tuberculosis pangenome and used it as a tool to seek genomic signatures associated with the clinical presentation of TB based on its accessory genome differences. The analysis carried out in the present study includes the raw reads of 490 M. tuberculosis genomes (PTB n = 245, EPTB n = 245) retrieved from public databases that were assembled, as well as ten genomes from Mexican strains (PTB n = 5, EPTB n = 5) that were sequenced and assembled. All genomes were annotated and then used to construct the pangenome with Roary and Panaroo. The pangenome obtained using Roary consisted of 2231 core genes and 3729 accessory genes. On the other hand, the pangenome resulting from Panaroo consisted of 2130 core genes and 5598 accessory genes. Associations between the distribution of accessory genes and the PTB/EPTB phenotypes were examined using the Scoary and Pyseer tools. Both tools found a significant association between the hspR, plcD, Rv2550c, pe_pgrs5, pe_pgrs25, and pe_pgrs57 genes and the PTB genotype. In contrast, the deletion of the aceA, esxR, plcA, and ppe50 genes was significantly associated with the EPTB phenotype. Rv1759c and Rv3740 were found to be associated with the PTB phenotype according to Scoary; however, these associations were not observed when using Pyseer. The robustness of the constructed pangenome and the gene-phenotype associations is supported by several factors, including the analysis of a large number of genomes, the inclusion of the same number of PTB/EPTB genomes, and the reproducibility of results thanks to the different bioinformatic tools used. Such characteristics surpass most of previous M. tuberculosis pangenomes. Thus, it can be inferred that the deletion of these genes can lead to changes in the processes involved in stress response and fatty acid metabolism, conferring phenotypic advantages associated with pulmonary or extrapulmonary presentation of TB. This study represents the first attempt to use the pangenome to seek gene-phenotype associations in M. tuberculosis.",Microorganisms,,37374997,肺外的；泛基因组；结核病,,2023-06-28,10.3390/microorganisms11061495,结核病（TB）是全球范围内由传染性疾病导致的主要死亡原因之一，由结核分枝杆菌引起的感染可发生在肺部导致肺结核（PTB），或发生在身体其他器官导致肺外结核（EPTB）。目前尚未就可能导致EPTB的病原体遗传决定因素达成共识。本研究构建了结核分枝杆菌的泛基因组，并将其作为工具，基于其辅助基因组差异来寻找与TB临床表现相关的基因组特征。本研究分析了从公共数据库获取的490株结核分枝杆菌基因组的原始读数（PTB n=245，EPTB n=245），以及来自墨西哥菌株的10个基因组（PTB n=5，EPTB n=5），这些基因组均已完成组装和注释，随后用于使用Roary和Panaroo构建泛基因组。使用Roary构建的泛基因组包含2231个核心基因和3729个辅助基因，而使用Panaroo构建的泛基因组则包含2130个核心基因和5598个辅助基因。通过Scoary和Pyseer工具对辅助基因分布与PTB/EPTB表型之间的关联进行了分析。两种工具均发现hspR、plcD、Rv2550c、pe_pgrs5、pe_pgrs25和pe_pgrs57基因与PTB基因型之间存在显著关联。相反，aceA、esxR、plcA和ppe50基因的缺失则与EPTB表型显著相关。根据Scoary的结果，Rv1759c和Rv3740与PTB表型相关，但使用Pyseer时未观察到这种关联。所构建泛基因组及其基因-表型关联的稳健性得到了多个因素的支持，包括分析大量基因组、包含相同数量的PTB/EPTB基因组以及由于使用不同生物信息学工具而获得结果的可重复性。这些特点超过了大多数先前的结核分枝杆菌泛基因组。因此可以推断，这些基因的缺失可能导致参与应激反应和脂肪酸代谢的过程发生变化，从而赋予与肺结核或肺外结核表型相关的表型优势。本研究首次尝试利用泛基因组在结核分枝杆菌中寻找基因-表型关联。

Simple text formats, like VCF or BED, have been widely adopted and helped the critical exchange of genomic information. There is a dire need for tools and formats enabling pangenomic annotation to facilitate such enrichment of pangenomic references. The Graph Alignment Format (GAF) is a text format, tab-delimited like BED/VCF files, which was proposed to represent alignments. GAF could also be used to store paths representing annotations in a pangenome graph, but there are no tools to index and query them efficiently. Here, we present extensions to vg and HTSlib that provide efficient sorting, indexing, and querying for GAF files. With this approach, annotations overlapping a subgraph can be extracted quickly. Paths are sorted based on the IDs of traversed nodes, compressed with BGZIP, and indexed with HTSlib/tabix via our extensions for the GAF format. Compared to the binary GAM format, GAF files are easier to edit or inspect because they are plain text, and we show that they are twice as fast to sort and half as large on disk. In addition, we updated vg annotate, which takes BED or GFF3 annotation files relative to linear sequences and projects them into the pangenome. It can now produce GAF files representing these annotations' paths through the pangenome. We showcase these new tools on several applications. We projected annotations for all Human Pangenome Reference Consortium Year 1 haplotypes, including genes, segmental duplications, tandem repeats and repeats annotations, into the Minigraph-Cactus pangenome (GRCh38-based v1.1). We also projected known variants from the GWAS Catalog and expression QTLs from the GTEx project into the pangenome.

Tartary buckwheat and common buckwheat have been used globally and become well-known nutritious foods due to their high quantities of: proteins, flavonoids, and minerals. Moreover, its increasing demand makes it critical to improve nutraceutical, traits and yield. In this review, bioactive compounds accumulated in buckwheat were comprehensively evaluated according to their chemical structure, properties, and physiological function. Biosynthetic pathways of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and fagopyrin were methodically summarized, with the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis. Although there are classic synthesis pathways presented in the previous research, the metabolic flow of how these certain compounds are being synthesized in buckwheat still remains uncovered. The functional genes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonols, stress response, and plant development were identified based on multi-omics research. Furthermore, it delves into the applications of multi-omics in improving buckwheat's agronomic traits, including: yield, nutritional content, stress resilience, and bioactive compounds biosynthesis.

Since the late 1970s, the lake has undergone increasing eutrophication pressure, due to wastewater input, leading to the occurrence of frequent cyanobacterial blooms. The major difference observed between PAMP2011 and PAMP2012 MAGs was the lack of the saxitoxin gene cluster in PAMP2012, which also presented a smaller genome, while PAMP2011 presented the complete sxt cluster and all essential proteins and clusters. The pangenome analysis was performed with all Raphidiopsis/Cylindrospermopsis genomes available at NCBI to date, with the addition of PAMP2011 and PAMP2012 MAGs (All33 subset), but also without the South American strains (noSA subset), and only among the South American strains (SA10 and SA8 subsets). We observed a substantial increase in the core genome size for the 'noSA' subset, in comparison to 'All33' subset, and since the core genome reflects the closeness among the pangenome members, the results strongly suggest that the conservation level of the essential gene repertoire seems to be affected by the geographic origin of the strains being analyzed, supporting the existence of a distinct SA clade. The Raphidiopsis pangenome comprised a total of 7943 orthologous protein clusters, and the two new MAGs increased the pangenome size by 11%. The pangenome based phylogenetic relationships among the 33 analyzed genomes showed that the SA genomes clustered together with 99% bootstrap support, reinforcing the metabolic particularity of the Raphidiopsis South American clade, related to its saxitoxin producing unique ability, while also indicating a different evolutionary history due to its geographic isolation.",Harmful algae,,37951618,念珠藻目；蓝细菌水华；系统发育；潘普利亚湖；宏基因组学,,2023-11-12,10.1016/j.hal.2023.102518,从2011年和2012年采自巴西贝洛奥里藏特市（米纳斯吉拉斯州）帕姆普拉湖的两个淡水宏基因组数据集中，成功恢复了两种Raphidiopsis（=Cylindrospermopsis）raciborskii宏基因组组装基因组（MAGs）。自20世纪70年代末以来，由于废水输入，该超富营养化的人工浅水水库经历了日益严重的富营养化压力，导致频繁发生蓝藻水华。PAMP2011和PAMP2012 MAGs的主要差异在于PAMP2012缺乏石房蛤毒素基因簇，同时其基因组较小，而PAMP2011则携带完整的sxt基因簇以及所有必需的蛋白质和基因簇。通过NCBI数据库中所有可用的Raphidiopsis/Cylindrospermopsis基因组进行泛基因组分析，包括PAMP2011和PAMP2012 MAGs（All33子集），但排除南美菌株（noSA子集），以及仅限于南美菌株（SA10和SA8子集）。我们观察到与“All33”子集相比，“noSA”子集的核心基因组大小显著增加，鉴于核心基因组反映了泛基因组成员之间的亲缘关系，结果强烈表明关键基因库的保守程度似乎受到被分析菌株地理来源的影响，支持存在一个独特的南美（SA）分支的观点。Raphidiopsis的泛基因组包含总共7943个直系同源蛋白簇，这两个新MAGs使泛基因组规模增加了11%。基于泛基因组的系统发育关系分析显示，33个分析基因组中的南美（SA）基因组以99%的自展支持率聚类在一起，进一步证实了Raphidiopsis南美分支在产生石房蛤毒素方面的独特代谢特性，同时也表明由于地理隔离导致了不同的进化历史。

We discuss how novel adaptive zones are colonized and exploited after the evolution of a key innovation and whether certain types of are more prone to adaptive radiation.

To help identify such candidate genes, several recent tools estimate microbial gene copy numbers directly from metagenomes. These tools rely on alignments to pangenomes, which in turn are derived from the set of all individual genomes from one species. While large-scale metagenomic assembly efforts have made pangenome estimates more complete, mixed communities can also introduce contamination into assemblies, and it is unknown how robust pangenome-based metagenomic analyses are to these errors. To gain insight into this problem, we re-analyzed a case-control study of the gut microbiome in cirrhosis, focusing on commensal Clostridia previously implicated in this disease. We tested for differentially prevalent genes in the Lachnospiraceae, then investigated which were likely to be contaminants using sequence similarity searches. Out of 86 differentially prevalent genes, we found that 33 (38%) were probably contaminants originating in taxa such as Veillonella and Haemophilus, unrelated genera that were independently correlated with disease status. Our results demonstrate that even small amounts of contamination in metagenome assemblies, below typical quality thresholds, can threaten to overwhelm gene-level metagenomic analyses. However, we also show that such contaminants can be accurately identified using a method based on gene-to-species correlation. After removing these contaminants, we observe that several flagellar motility gene clusters in the Lachnospira eligens pangenome are associated with cirrhosis status. We have integrated our analyses into an analysis and visualization pipeline, PanSweep, that can automatically identify cases where pangenome contamination may bias the results of gene-resolved analyses. Metagenome-assembled genomes, or MAGs, can be constructed without pure cultures of microbes. Large scale efforts to build MAGs have yielded more complete pangenomes (i.e., sets of all genes found in one species). Pangenomes allow us to measure strain variation in gene content, which can strongly affect phenotype. However, because MAGs come from mixed communities, they can contaminate pangenomes with unrelated DNA, and how much this impacts downstream analyses has not been studied. Using a metagenomic study of gut microbes in cirrhosis as our test case, we investigate how contamination affects analyses of microbial gene content. Surprisingly, even small, typical amounts of MAG contamination (<5%) result in disproportionately high levels of false positive associations (38%). Fortunately, we show that most contaminants can be automatically flagged, and provide a simple method for doing so.

Many species in the genus have been isolated and characterized. However, few studies have focused on marine isolates or fish pathogens, and in-depth genomic analyses, particularly comparative analyses of isolates from different habitat types, are lacking. Here, we isolated 20 strains of the genus from various environments in South Korea and sequenced their full-length genomes. Combined with published sequence data, we examined genomic traits, evolution, environmental adaptation, and putative metabolic functions in total 187 genomes of isolated species in Flavobacterium categorized as marine, host-associated, and terrestrial including freshwater. A pangenome analysis revealed a correlation between genome size and coding or noncoding density. Flavobacterium spp. had high levels of diversity, allowing for novel gene repertories via recombination events. Defense-related genes only accounted for approximately 3% of predicted genes in all Flavobacterium genomes. While genes involved in metabolic pathways did not differ with respect to isolation source, there was substantial variation in genomic traits; in particular, the abundances of tRNAs and rRNAs were higher in the host-associdated group than in other groups. One genome in the host-associated group contained a Microviridae prophage closely related to an enterobacteria phage. The proteorhodopsin gene was only identified in four terrestrial strains isolated for this study. Furthermore, recombination events clearly influenced genomic diversity and may contribute to the response to environmental stress. These findings shed light on the high genetic variation in Flavobacterium and functional roles in diverse ecosystems as a result of their metabolic versatility. IMPORTANCE The genus Flavobacterium is a diverse group of bacteria that are found in a variety of environments. While most species of this genus are harmless and utilize organic substrates such as proteins and polysaccharides, some members may play a significant role in the cycling for organic substances within their environments. Nevertheless, little is known about the genomic dynamics and/or metabolic capacity of Flavobacterium. Here, we found that Flavobacterium species may have an open pangenome, containing a variety of diverse and novel gene repertoires. Intriguingly, we discovered that one genome (classified into host-associated group) contained a Microviridae prophage closely related to that of enterobacteria.

The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) does not have significant efficacy against serotype 3 despite polysaccharide inclusion in the vaccine. It was hypothesized that PCV13 may effectively control Clade I of CC180 but that Clades III and IV are resistant, provoking a population shift that enables serotype 3 persistence. This has been observed in the United States, England, and Wales but not Spain. We tested this hypothesis further utilizing a dataset from Portugal. Methods We whole-genome sequenced (WGS) 501 serotype 3 strains from Portugal isolated from patients with pneumococcal infections between 1999-2020. The draft genomes underwent phylogenetic analyses, pangenome profiling, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We also completed antibiotic susceptibility testing and compiled over 2,600 serotype 3 multilocus sequence type 180 (MLST180) WGSs to perform global comparative genomics. Findings CC180 Clades I, II, III, IV, and VI distributions were similar when comparing non-invasive pneumonia isolates and invasive disease isolates (Fisher's exact test, P=0.29), and adult and pediatric cases (Fisher's exact test, P=0.074). The serotype 3 CCs shifted post-PCV13 (Fisher's exact test, P<0.0001) and Clade I became dominant. Clade I is largely antibiotic-sensitive and carries the phiOXC141 prophage but the pangenome is heterogenous. Strains from Portugal and Spain, where Clade I remains dominant post-PCV13, have larger pangenomes and are associated with the presence of two genes encoding hypothetical proteins. Interpretation Clade I became dominant in Portugal post-PCV13, despite the burden of the prophage and antibiotic sensitivity. The accessory genome content may mitigate these fitness costs. Regional differences in Clade I prevalence and pangenome heterogeneity suggest that clade dynamics is not a generalizable approach to understanding serotype 3 vaccine escape.

In this study, we conducted a metapangenomic analysis of oral Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species to uncover genomic diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and habitat specialization within the human oral cavity. Using three metrics-pangenomic gene content, phylogenomics, and average nucleotide identity (ANI)-we first identified distinct species and sub-species groups among these genera. Mapping of metagenomic reads then revealed clear patterns of habitat specialization, such as Aggregatibacter species predominantly in dental plaque, a distinctive Haemophilus parainfluenzae sub-species group on the tongue dorsum, and H. sp. HMT-036 predominantly in keratinized gingiva and buccal mucosa. In addition, we found that supragingival plaque samples contained predominantly only one out of the three taxa, H. parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, and A. sp.

Functional analyses revealed the presence of key metabolic genes, such as oxaloacetate decarboxylase, correlated with habitat specialization, suggesting metabolic versatility as a driving force. Additionally, heme synthesis distinguishes H. sp.

Overall, our study exemplifies the power of metapangenomics to identify factors that may affect ecological interactions within microbial communities, including genomic diversity, habitat specialization, and metabolic versatility. Understanding the microbial ecology of the mouth is essential for comprehending human physiology. This study employs metapangenomics to reveal that various Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species exhibit distinct ecological preferences within the oral cavity of healthy individuals, thereby supporting the site-specialist hypothesis.

It remains a major public health challenge in the endemic region around the Bay of Bengal. Over decadal time scales, one lineage typically dominates the others and spreads in global pandemic waves. However, it remains unclear to what extent diverse lineages co-circulate during a single outbreak season. Defining the pool of diversity during finer time scales is important because the selective pressures that impact V. cholerae - namely antibiotics and phages - are dynamic on these time scales. To study the nationwide diversity of V. cholerae, we long-read sequenced 273 V. cholerae genomes from seven hospitals over one year (2018) in Bangladesh. Four major V. cholerae lineages were identified: known lineages BD-1, BD-2a, and BD-2b, and a novel lineage that we call BD-3. In 2022, BD-1 caused a large cholera outbreak in Dhaka, apparently outcompeting BD-2 lineages. We show that, in 2018, BD-1 was already dominant in the five northern regions, including Dhaka, consistent with an origin from India in the north. By contrast, we observed a higher diversity of lineages in the two southern regions near the coast. The four lineages differed in pangenome content, including integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) and genes involved in resistance to bacteriophages and antibiotics. Notably, BD-2a lacked an ICE and is predicted to be more sensitive to phages and antibiotics, but nevertheless persisted throughout the year-long sampling period.

Infections by the Borreliaceae are difficult to detect by both direct and indirect methods, often leading to delayed and missed diagnoses. Efforts to improve diagnoses center around the development of molecular diagnostics (MDx), but due to deep tissue sequestration of the causative spirochaetes and the lack of persistent bacteremias, even MDx assays suffer from a lack of sensitivity. Additionally, the highly extensive genomic heterogeneity among isolates, even within the same species, contributes to the lack of assay sensitivity as single target assays cannot provide universal coverage. This within-species heterogeneity is partly due to differences in replicon repertoires and genomic structures that have likely arisen to support the complex Borreliaceae lifecycle in which these parasites have to survive in multiple hosts each with unique immune responses. We constructed a Borreliaceae family-level pangenome and characterized the phylogenetic relationships among the constituent taxa which supports the recent taxonomy of splitting the family into at least two genera. Gene content pro les were created for the majority of the Borreliaceae replicons, providing for the first time their unambiguous molecular typing.

Recently, a compressed-index data structure called the ""move structure"" was proposed as an alternative to other BWT-based indexes like the FM index and r-index. The move structure uniquely achieves both O(r) space and O(1)-time queries, where r is the number of runs in the pangenome BWT. We implemented Movi, an efficient tool for building and querying move-structure pangenome indexes. While the size of the Movi's index is larger than the r-index, it scales at a smaller rate for pangenome references, as its size is exactly proportional to r, the number of runs in the BWT of the reference. Movi can compute sophisticated matching queries needed for classification - such as pseudo-matching lengths and backward search - at least ten times faster than the fastest available methods, and in some cases more than 30-fold faster. Movi achieves this speed by leveraging the move structure's strong locality of reference, incurring close to the minimum possible number of cache misses for queries against large pangenomes. We achieve still further speed improvements by using memory prefetching to attain a degree of latency hiding that would be difficult with other index structures like the r-index.

So far, the search for the molecular background of such diverse behavior has led to inconsistent results. In the present study, we prospectively collected C. acnes strains from 27 infected persons and 18 healthy controls employing rigid selection criteria to ensure their role as infectious agent or colonizer. The genome sequences from these strains were obtained and carefully controlled for quality. Deduced traditional phylotyping assigned almost all superficial isolates to type IA1, while the clinical strains were evenly distributed between types IA1, IB, and II. Single locus sequence typing (SLST) showed a predominance of A1 type for the control strains, whereas 56% of the clinical isolates belonged to types A1, H1 and K8.

Salt stressors have adverse impacts on the plant's ionic, osmotic, and oxidative balance, as well as numerous physiological functions. Plants have a variety of coping strategies to deal with salt stress, including osmosensing, osmoregulation, ion-homeostasis, increased antioxidant synthesis, and so on. Not only does salt stress cause oxidative stress but also many types of stress do as well, thus plants have an effective antioxidant system to battle the negative effects of excessive reactive oxygen species produced as a result of stress. Rising salinity in the agricultural field affects crop productivity and plant development considerably; nevertheless, plants have a well-known copying mechanism that shields them from salt stress by facilitated production of secondary metabolites, antioxidants, ionhomeostasis, ABAbiosynthesis, and so on. To address this problem, various environment-friendly solutions such as salt-tolerant plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, eco-friendly additives, and foliar applications of osmoprotectants/antioxidants are urgently needed.

Unlike prokaryotic microbes, which display frequent horizontal gene transfer events and multiple inputs of energy and organic carbon, land plants predominantly rely on organic carbon generated from CO2 and have experienced relatively few gene transfers during their recent evolutionary history.

Stomata couple homoiohydry, together with cuticles, intercellular gas space, with the endohydric water-conducting system, enabling plants to adapt and diversify across the planet. Plants control stomatal movement in response to environmental change through regulating guard cell turgor mediated by membrane transporters and signaling transduction. However, the origin, evolution, and active control of stomata remain controversial topics. We first review stomatal evolution and diversity, providing fossil and phylogenetic evidence of their origins. We summarize functional evolution of guard cell membrane transporters in the context of climate changes and environmental stresses. Our analyses show that the core signaling elements of stomatal movement are more ancient than stomata, while genes involved in stomatal development co-evolved de novo with the earliest stomata. These results suggest that novel stomatal development-specific genes were acquired during plant evolution, whereas genes regulating stomatal movement, especially cell signaling pathways, were inherited ancestrally and co-opted by dynamic functional differentiation.

Plant transporters play significant roles in nutrient uptake, cellular balance, and stress responses. They facilitate the exchange of chemicals and signals across the plant's membrane by signal transduction, osmotic adjustment, and ion homeostasis. Therefore, research into plant transporters is crucial for understanding the mechanics of plant stress tolerance. Transporters have potential applications in crop breeding for increased stress resistance. We discuss new results about various transporter families (ABC, MATE, NRAMP, NRT, PHT, ZIP), including their functions in abiotic stress tolerance and plant development. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of transporters in plant responses to abiotic stresses such as drought, cold, salt, and heavy metal toxicity, low light, flooding, and nutrient deficiencies. We discuss the transporter pathways and processes involved in diverse plant stress responses.

It enhances osmolyte production, increases antioxidant enzyme activity, and improves photosynthesis, thereby improving cellular functions. Understanding the melatonin-mediated response and signalling can sustain crop production in heavy metal-stressed soils. Melatonin is a pleiotropic signal molecule that plays a critical role in plant growth and stress tolerance, particularly against heavy metals in soil. Heavy metals (HMs) are ubiquitously found in the soil-water environment and readily taken up by plants, thereby disrupting mineral nutrient homeostasis, osmotic balance, oxidative stress, and altered primary and secondary metabolism. Plants combat HM stress through inbuilt defensive mechanisms, such as metal exclusion, restricted foliar translocation, metal sequestration and compartmentalization, chelation, and scavenging of free radicals by antioxidant enzymes. Melatonin has a protective effect against the damaging effects of HM stress in plants. It achieves this by immobilizing HM in cell walls and sequestering them in root cell vacuoles, reducing HM's translocation from roots to shoots. This mechanism improves the uptake of macronutrients and micronutrients in plants. Additionally, melatonin enhances osmolyte production, improving the plant's water relations, and increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes to limit lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels.

More than 25 Trichoderma species have been extensively studied and have demonstrated significant potential in inhibiting not only phytopathogen growth but also insect pest infestations. In addition to their use as biopesticides, there is increasing evidence that several Trichoderma species can function as fungal endophytes by colonizing the tissues of specific plants. This colonization enhances a plant's growth and improves its tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. In recent decades, there has been a proliferation of literature on the role of Trichoderma endophytes in crop protection. Although the mechanisms underlying plant-fungal endophyte interactions are not yet fully understood, several studies have suggested their potential application in agriculture, particularly in the mitigation of plant pests and diseases.

Intercellular and intracellular microbial symbionts that are asymptomatic in their plant host during some or all of their life cycle - endophytes - can form mutualistic, commensal, or pathogenic relationships, and sometimes novel associations with alien plants. Fungal endophytes are likely the most common endosymbiont infecting plants, with life-history, morphological, physiological, and plant-symbiotic traits that are distinct from other endophytic guilds. Here, we review the community dynamics of fungal endophytes during the process of plant invasion, and how their functional role may shift during the different stages of invasion: transport, introduction (colonisation), establishment, and spread. Each invasion stage presents distinct ecological filters that an alien plant must overcome to advance to the subsequent stage of invasion. Endophytes can alternately aid the host in overcoming stage-specific filters, or contribute to the barriers imposed by filters (e.g. biotic resistance), thereby affecting invasion pathways. A few fungi can be transported as seed endophytes from their native range and be vertically transmitted to future generations in the non-native range, especially in graminoids. In other plant groups, alien plants mostly acquire endophytes via horizontal transmission from the invaded plant community, and the host endophyte community is shaped by host filtering and biogeographic factors (e.g. dispersal limitation, environmental filtering). Endophytes infecting alien plants (both those transported with their host and those accumulated in the non-native range) may influence invasion success by affecting plant growth, reproduction, environmental tolerance, and pathogen and herbivory defences; however, the direction and magnitude of these effects can be contingent upon the host identity, life stage, ecological conditions, and invasion stage. This context dependence may cause endophytic fungi to shift to a non-endophytic (e.g. pathogenic) functional life stage in the same or different hosts, which can modify alien-native plant community dynamics. We conclude by identifying paths in which alien hosts can exploit the context dependency of endophyte function in novel abiotic and biotic conditions and at the different stages of invasion.",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,,38629189,生物防治；疾病介导的入侵；真菌内生菌；入侵植物；真菌病原体；群落组装；植物-真菌相互作用；天敌释放,,2024-04-17,10.1111/brv.13085,共生微生物可能影响宿主植物的生长成败、维持可存活种群的能力，以及其在原生范围之外建立和扩散的可能性。某些或全部生命周期内无症状的细胞间和细胞内微生物共生体——内生菌——可以与宿主植物形成互利共生、共生或致病关系，并有时与外来植物形成新的关联。真菌内生菌可能是感染植物最常见的内共生体，其生活史、形态学、生理学及与植物的共生特性与其他内生菌群体有明显区别。本文综述了真菌内生菌在植物入侵过程中的群落动态变化，以及其功能角色在入侵的不同阶段（运输、引入[定殖]、建立和扩散）如何发生变化。每个入侵阶段都存在独特的生态过滤器，外来植物必须克服这些过滤器才能进入下一阶段的入侵。内生菌可以交替帮助宿主克服特定阶段的过滤器，或者加剧过滤器施加的障碍（如生物抗性），从而影响入侵路径。少数真菌可以通过种子内生菌从其原生范围传播，并通过垂直传播传递给非原生范围内的下一代，特别是在禾本科植物中。在其他植物类群中，外来植物主要通过水平传播从入侵地植物群落中获得内生菌，宿主内生菌群落受宿主过滤和生物地理因素（如散布限制、环境过滤）的影响。感染外来植物的内生菌（无论是随宿主传播还是在非原生范围积累）可能通过影响植物生长、繁殖、环境适应性以及对病原体和食草动物防御能力来影响入侵成功；然而，这些效应的方向和强度可能取决于宿主身份、生命阶段、生态条件和入侵阶段。这种情境依赖性可能导致内生真菌在相同或不同宿主中转变为非内生（如致病）的功能阶段，从而改变外来-本地植物群落动态。最后，我们指出了外来宿主如何利用内生菌功能在新环境中的情境依赖性，以及在入侵的不同阶段中利用这一特性的方式。

Furthermore, investigations that involve multimodal molecular imaging approaches combining MSI with other imaging techniques are described. The advantages and limitations of the different MSI techniques that influence their applicability in diverse agro-food studies are described to enable informed choices for tailored analyses. For example, some MSI technologies involve meticulous sample preparation while others compromise spatial resolution to gain throughput. Key parameters such as sensitivity, ionization bias and fragmentation, reference database and compound class specificity are described and discussed in this review.

Active restoration frequently involves revegetation, which leads to the dilemma of whether to conduct direct seeding or to plant nursery-grown seedlings. The choice of revegetation method can regulate plant survival and performance, with economic implications that ultimately feed back to our capacity to conduct restoration. We followed a peer-reviewed protocol to develop a systematic map that collates, describes and catalogues the available studies on how seeding compares to planting in achieving restoration targets. We compiled a database with the characteristics of all retrieved studies, which can be searched to identify studies of particular locations and habitats, objectives of restoration, plant material, technical aspects, and outcomes measured. The search was made in eight languages and retrieved 3355 publications, of which 178 were retained. The systematic map identifies research gaps, such as a lack of studies in the global South, in tropical rainforests, and covering a long time period, which represent opportunities to expand field-based research. Additionally, many studies overlooked reporting on important technical aspects such as seed provenance and nursery cultivation methods, and others such as watering or seedling protection were more frequently applied for planting than for seeding, which limits our capacity to learn from past research. Most studies measured outcomes related to the target plants but avoided measuring general restoration outcomes or economic aspects. This represents a relevant gap in research, as the choice of revegetation method is greatly based on economic aspects and the achievement of restoration goals goes beyond the establishment of plants. Finally, we identified a substantial volume of studies conducted in temperate regions and over short periods (0-5 y). This research cluster calls for a future in-depth synthesis, potentially through meta-analysis, to reveal the overall balance between seeding and planting and assess whether the response to this question is mediated by species traits, environmental characteristics, or technical aspects.

In response to DS, plants synthesize or accumulate various plant growth regulators (PGRs), including phytohormones, neurotransmitters, gasotransmitters, and polyamines, which present promising sustainable green chemical strategies to adapt or tolerate stress conditions. These PGRs orchestrate crucial plant structure and function adjustments, activating defense systems and modulating cellular-level responses, transcript levels, transcription factors, metabolic genes, and stress-responsive candidate proteins. However, the efficacy of these molecules in mitigating DS depends on the plant species, applied PGR dose, treatment type, duration of DS exposure, and growth stages. Thus, exploring the integrated impact of PGRs on enhancing plant fitness and DS tolerance is crucial for global food security and sustainable agriculture. This review investigates plant responses to DS, explains the potential of exogenously applied diverse PGRs, dissects the complex chemistry among PGRs, and sheds light on omics approaches for harnessing the molecular basis of DS tolerance. This updated review delivers comprehensive mechanistic insights for leveraging various PGRs to enhance overall plant fitness under DS conditions.",Physiologia plantarum,,39513406,植物生长调节剂;干旱胁迫;植物健康;信号传导;代谢基因;转录因子;可持续农业;分子生物学;生物技术,,2024-11-13,10.1111/ppl.14605,随着全球气候变化的加剧，各种非生物胁迫的发生频率和严重程度将对植物健康和生产力构成重大威胁。干旱胁迫（DS）是一种严峻的障碍，通过特定的形态学、生理学、生化和分子机制扰乱植物的正常功能。理解植物如何应对DS对于减轻其不利影响至关重要。在DS条件下，植物合成或积累多种植物生长调节剂（PGRs），包括植物激素、神经递质、气体信号分子和多胺等，这些物质为适应或耐受胁迫条件提供了有前景的可持续绿色化学策略。这些PGRs协调关键的植物结构与功能调整，激活防御系统并调控细胞水平的响应、转录水平、转录因子、代谢基因以及胁迫响应候选蛋白。然而，这些分子在缓解DS方面的效果取决于植物种类、施用的PGR剂量、处理方式、DS暴露时长以及生长阶段。因此，探索PGRs综合影响以提高植物适应性和DS耐受性的研究对于全球粮食安全和可持续农业具有重要意义。本文综述了植物对DS的响应，解释了外源施用不同PGRs的潜力，剖析了PGRs之间的复杂化学关系，并揭示了利用组学方法挖掘DS耐受性分子基础的可能性。本综述更新了关于利用各种PGRs增强DS条件下植物整体适应性的全面机制见解。

Following the stoppage of irrigation, and the post maintenance phase (2017-2021), modules initially planted with Sedum continued to sustain cover and biomass whereas planted forbs and grasses mostly disappeared, and these treatments were overtaken by Sedum.

The present review highlights the valuable contribution of omics approaches (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) to characterize the intricate response to As overall, which could empower As-tolerant plant development. Genomic techniques, such as QTL mapping, GWAS, RAPD, and SSH, hold the potential to provide valuable insights into the genetic diversity and expression patterns associated with the plant response to As stress, highlighting also the power of new advanced technology such as CRISPR-Cas9.

Among the major abiotic stressors affecting crop plants, variations in temperature, water availability, salinity, and cold pose significant threats to crop yield and the quality of produce. Plants possess remarkable adaptability and resilience, and they employ a range of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms to respond and cope with abiotic stresses. A few crucial set of epigenetic mechanisms that support plants in their battle against these stresses includes DNA methylation and histone modifications. These mechanisms play a pivotal role in enabling plants to endure and thrive under challenging environmental conditions. The mechanisms of different epigenetic mechanisms in responding to the abiotic stresses vary.

Recent research has shown that the rhizosphere environment is far more dynamic than previously recognised, with evidence emerging for diurnal rhythmicity in rhizosphere chemistry and microbial community composition. This rhythmicity is in part linked to the host plant's circadian rhythm, although some heterotrophic rhizosphere bacteria and fungi may also possess intrinsic rhythmicity. We review the evidence for diurnal rhythmicity in rhizosphere microbial communities and its link to the plant circadian clock. Factors which may drive microbial rhythmicity are discussed, including diurnal change in root exudate flux and composition, rhizosphere physico-chemical properties and plant immunity. Microbial processes which could contribute to community rhythmicity are considered, including self-sustained microbial rhythms, bacterial movement into and out of the rhizosphere, and microbe-microbe interactions. We also consider evidence that changes in microbial composition mediated by the plant circadian clock may affect microbial function and its significance for plant health and broader soil biogeochemical cycling processes. We identify key knowledge gaps and approaches which could help to resolve the spatial and temporal variation and functional significance of rhizosphere microbial rhythmicity. This includes unravelling the factors which determine the oscillation of microbial activity, growth and death, and cross-talk with the host over diurnal time frames.

Plant strategy theory is essential for understanding the assembly of plant communities, predicting plant responses to climate change, and enhancing the restoration of our degrading biosphere. However, models of plant strategies vary widely and have tended to emphasize either functional traits or life-history traits at the expense of integrating both into a general framework to improve our ecological and evolutionary understanding of plant form and function. Advancing our understanding of plant strategies will require investment in two complementary research agendas that together will unify functional ecology and population ecology. First, we must determine what is phenotypically possible by quantifying the dimensionality of plant traits. This step requires dense taxonomic sampling of traits on species representing the broad diversity of phylogenetic clades, environmental gradients, and geographical regions found across Earth. It is important that we continue to sample traits locally and share data globally to fill biased gaps in trait databases. Second, we must test the power of traits for explaining species distributions, demographic rates, and population growth rates across gradients of resource limitation, disturbance regimes, temperature, vegetation density, and frequencies of other strategies. This step requires thoughtful, theory-driven empiricism. Reciprocal transplant experiments beyond the native range and synthetic demographic modelling are the most powerful methods to determine how trait-by-environment interactions influence fitness. Moving beyond easy-to-measure traits and evaluating the traits that are under the strongest ecological selection within different environmental contexts will improve our understanding of plant adaptations.

As genome assembly methods continue to advance and production costs become a less significant obstacle, genome assemblies for multiple inbred rat strains are emerging. These assemblies will allow a rat pangenome assembly to be constructed that captures all the genetic variations in strains selected for their utility in research and will overcome reference bias, a limitation associated with reliance on a single reference assembly.

Genome browsers are software data visualization and exploration tools that enable biologists to answer questions such as these. In this paper, we report on a major update to our browser, Genome Explorer, that provides nearly instantaneous scaling and traversing of a genome, enabling users to quickly and easily zoom into an area of interest. The user can rapidly move between scales that depict the entire genome, individual genes, and the sequence; Genome Explorer presents the most relevant detail and context for each scale. By downloading the data for the entire genome to the user's web browser and dynamically generating visualizations locally, we enable ﬁne control of zoom and pan functions and real-time redrawing of the visualization, resulting in smoother and more intuitive exploration of a genome than is possible with other browsers. Further, genome features are presented together, in-line, using familiar graphical depictions. In contrast, many other browsers depict genome features using data tracks, which have low information density and can visually obscure the relative positions of features. Genome Explorer diagrams have a high information density that provides larger amounts of genome context and sequence information to be presented in a given-sized monitor than for tracks-based browsers. Genome Explorer provides optional data tracks for the analysis of large-scale data sets and a unique comparative mode that aligns genomes at orthologous genes with synchronized zooming. Genome browsers provide graphical depictions of genome information to speed the uptake of complex genome data by scientists.

It represents a habitat where there is contact between seed-associated microbes and soil microbes, but it is studied less than other plant habitats. Previous studies on spermosphere microbiology were primarily culture based or did not sample the spermosphere soil as initially defined in space and time. Thus, the objectives of this study were to develop an efficient strategy to collect spermosphere soils around imbibing soybean and cotton in nonsterile soil and investigate changes in microbial communities. The method employed sufficiently collected spermosphere soil as initially defined in space by constraining the soil sampled with a cork borer and confining the soil to a 12-well microtiter plate. Spermosphere prokaryote composition changed over time and depended on the crop within 6 h after seeds were sown. By 12 to 18 h, crops had unique microbial communities in spermosphere soils. Prokaryote evenness dropped following seed imbibition, with the proliferation of copiotrophic soil bacteria. Due to their long history of plant growth promotion, prokaryote operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Burkholderia, Massilia, Azospirillum, and Pseudomonas were notable organisms enriched. Fungi and prokaryotes were hub taxa in cotton and soybean spermosphere networks. Additionally, the enriched taxa were not hubs in networks, suggesting that other taxa besides those enriched may be important for spermosphere communities. Overall, this study advances knowledge in the assembly of the plant microbiome early in a plant's life, which may have plant health implications in more mature plant growth stages. IMPORTANCE The central hypothesis of this research was that plant species and seed exudate release would alter the assembly of microbes in the spermosphere soil. Our research investigated the response of microbes to the initial burst of nutrients into the spermosphere soil, filling knowledge gaps from previous studies that pregerminated seeds under sterile conditions. We identified several copiotrophic bacterial lineages with a long history of plant growth promotion proliferating in response to the initial exudate release. With a comparative network approach, we show that these copiotrophic bacteria are not central to networks, demonstrating that other microbes (including fungi) may be important for community structure.

In this context, GC% can provide insights into virus-host relationships and evolution. Here, we present a comprehensive gene-by-gene analysis of 61 representatives belonging to the phylum Nucleocytoviricota, which comprises viruses with the largest genomes known in the virosphere. Parameters were evaluated not only based on the average GC% of a given viral species compared to the entire phylum but also considering gene position and phylogenetic history. Our results reveal that while some families exhibit similar GC% among their representatives (e.g., Marseilleviridae), others such as Poxviridae, Phycodnaviridae, and Mimiviridae have members with discrepant GC% values, likely reflecting adaptation to specific biological cycles and hosts.

Despite the high mortality associated with Chagas, relatively few parasite genomes have been assembled to date, with genome assemblies unavailable even for some commonly used laboratory strains. This is at least partially due to T. cruzi's highly complex and highly repetitive genome, which defies investigation using traditional short-read sequencing methods. In this study, we have generated a high-quality whole-genome assembly of the hybrid Tulahuen strain, a commercially available type VI strain, using long-read Nanopore sequencing without short-read scaffolding. The assembled genome contains 25% repeat regions, 17% variable multigene family members, and 27% transposable elements (TEs) and is of comparable quality with T. cruzi genome assemblies that utilized both long- and short-read data. Notably, we find that regions with TEs are significantly enriched for multicopy surface proteins, and that surface proteins are, on average, closer to TEs than to other coding regions. This finding suggests that mobile genetic elements such as transposons may drive recombination within surface protein gene families.

The detrimental effects of these environmental factors can be seen in leaf and stem anatomical structures including the decrease in thickness of cell walls, palisade and spongy tissue, phloem and xylem tissue. Also, the disintegration of grana staking, and an increase in the size of mitochondria were observed under salinity and drought conditions. Drought and salt stresses can significantly decrease plant height, number of leaves and branches, leaf area, fresh and dry weight, or plant relative water content (RWC%) and concentration of photosynthetic pigments. On the other hand, stress-induced lipid peroxidation and malondialdehyde (MDA) production, electrolyte leakage (EL%), and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can increase under salinity and drought conditions. Antioxidant defense systems such as catalase, peroxidase, glutathione reductase, ascorbic acid, and gamma-aminobutyric acid are essential components under drought and salt stresses to protect the plant organelles from oxidative damage caused by ROS. The application of safe and eco-friendly treatments is a very important strategy to overcome the adverse effects of drought and salinity on the growth characteristics and yield of plants. It is shown that treatments with plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can improve morphoanatomical characteristics under salinity and drought stress. It is also shown that yeast extract, mannitol, proline, melatonin, silicon, chitosan, α-Tocopherols (vitamin E), and biochar alleviate the negative effects of drought and salinity stresses through the ROS scavenging resulting in the improvement of plant attributes and yield of the stressed plants.

We used chromosomal-level assemblies from eight Fusarium graminearum isolates to study structural variants and their role in fungal evolution. We generated the assemblies of four of these genomes after Oxford Nanopore sequencing. A total of 87 inversions, 159 translocations, 245 duplications, 58,489 insertions, and 34,102 deletions were detected. Regions of high recombination rate are associated with structural rearrangements, and a significant proportion of inversions, translocations, and duplications overlap with the repeat content of the genome, suggesting recombination and repeat elements are major factors in the origin of structural rearrangements in F. graminearum. Large insertions and deletions introduce presence-absence polymorphisms for many genes, including secondary metabolite biosynthesis cluster genes and predicted effectors genes. Translocation events were found to be shuffling predicted effector-rich regions of the genomes and are likely contributing to the gain and loss of effectors facilitated by recombination. Breakpoints of some structural rearrangements fall within coding sequences and are likely altering the protein products. Structural rearrangements in F. graminearum thus have an important role to play in shaping pathogen-host interactions and broader evolution through genome reorganization, the introduction of presence-absence polymorphisms, and changing protein products and gene regulation.","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",,38546739,转座元件；牛津纳米孔测序；重组；结构变异；结构重排；禾谷镰刀菌,,2024-03-28,10.1093/g3journal/jkae065,"染色体结构重排，如倒位、易位、重复以及大片段插入和缺失等，是大规模基因组变异，可能在表型变异的形成、基因组适应与进化中发挥重要作用。我们利用来自8个禾谷镰刀菌分离株的染色体水平基因组组装数据，研究了结构变异及其在真菌进化中的作用。通过牛津纳米孔测序技术，我们完成了其中4个基因组的组装。共检测到87个倒位、159个易位、245个重复、58,489个插入和34,102个缺失。高重组率区域与结构重排相关联，且大量倒位、易位和重复与基因组的重复序列内容重叠，表明重组和重复元件可能是禾谷镰刀菌结构重排的主要因素。大片段插入和缺失引入了许多基因（包括次生代谢物生物合成簇基因和预测效应蛋白基因）的存在-缺失多态性。易位事件被发现会打乱基因组中预测的效应蛋白富集区域，并可能通过重组促进效应蛋白的获得与丢失。部分结构重排的断点位于编码序列内，可能改变蛋白质产物。因此，禾谷镰刀菌中的结构重排通过基因组重排、存在-缺失多态性的引入以及改变蛋白质产物和基因调控，在塑造病原体-宿主互作及更广泛的基因组进化过程中发挥了重要作用。"

Chelmon rostratus, comprising 24 chromosomes assembled to the chromosome level, could be served as a reference genome for butterflyfish. By conducting a collinearity analysis between butterflyfishes and several fishes, we elucidated the specific and conserved genomic features of butterflyfish, with particular emphasis on novel genes arising from tandem duplications and their potential functions. In addition to the two melanocyte-specific tyr genes commonly found in fish, we found the gene tyrp3, a new tyrosinase-related proteins gene in the reef fish, including butterflyfish and clownfish, implicating their involvement in the pigmentation diversity of fish.

Most tools are specialized for a single task, and additional eﬀorts are necessary to integrate and visualize the results. To ﬁll this gap, we developed zDB, an application integrating a Nextﬂow analysis pipeline and a Python visualization platform built on the Django framework. The application is available on GitHub (https://github.com/metagenlab/zDB) and from the bioconda channel. Starting from annotated Genbank ﬁles, zDB identiﬁes orthologs and infers a phylogeny for each orthogroup. A species phylogeny is also constructed from shared single-copy orthologs. The results can be enriched with Pfam protein domain prediction, Cluster of Orthologs Genes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotations, and Swissprot homologs. The web application allows searching for speciﬁc genes or annotations, running Blast queries, and comparing genomic regions and whole genomes. The metabolic capacities of organisms can be compared at either the module or pathway levels. Finally, users can run queries to examine the conservation of speciﬁc genes or annotations across a chosen subset of genomes and display the results as a list of genes, Venn diagram, or heatmaps. Those features make zDB useful for both bioinformaticians and researchers more accustomed to laboratory research.IMPORTANCEGenome comparison and analysis rely on many independent tools, leaving to scientists the burden to integrate and visualize their results for interpretation. To alleviate this burden, we have built zDB, a comparative genomics tool that includes both an analysis pipeline and a visualization platform. The analysis pipeline automates gene annotation, orthology prediction, and phylogenetic inference, while the visualization platform allows scientists to easily explore the results in a web browser. Among other features, the interface allows users to visually compare whole genomes and targeted regions, assess the conservation of genes or metabolic pathways, perform Blast searches, or look for speciﬁc annotations. Altogether, this tool will be useful for a broad range of applications in comparative studies between two and hundred genomes.

While these species appear morphologically identical, differences exist in the genetic makeup, geographical range, and possibly the clinical presentation of infection. Here, we show genetic divergence between the cryptic species through both a Blastomyces species tree constructed from orthologous protein sequences and whole genome single-nucleotide variant phylogenomic analysis. Following linked-read sequencing and de novo genome assembly, we characterized and compared the genomes of 3 B. dermatitidis and 3 B. gilchristii isolates. The B. gilchristii genomes (73.25-75.4 Mb) were ∼8 Mb larger than the B. dermatitidis genomes (64.88-66.61 Mb). Average nucleotide identity was lower between genomes of different species than genomes of the same species, yet functional classification of genes suggested similar proteomes. The most striking difference involved long terminal repeat retrotransposons. Although the same retrotransposon elements were detected in the genomes, the quantity of elements differed between the 2 species. Gypsy retrotransposon content was significantly higher in B. gilchristii (38.04-39.26 Mb) than in B. dermatitidis (30.85-32.40 Mb), accounting for the majority of genome size difference between species. Age estimation and phylogenetic analysis of the reverse transcriptase domains suggested that these retrotransposons are relatively ancient, with genome insertion predating the speciation of B. dermatitidis and B. gilchristii.

However, significant knowledge gaps exist in understanding the detailed mechanisms for this hardwood-pathogenic fungus. To address this issue, five monokaryotic P. fraxinea strains, SS1 to SS5, were isolated from the tree species Robinia pseudoacacia, and high polysaccharide-degrading activities and the fastest growth were found for P. fraxinea SS3 among the isolates. The whole genome of P. fraxinea SS3 was sequenced, and its unique CAZyme potential for tree pathogenicity was determined in comparison to the genomes of other nonpathogenic Polyporales. These CAZyme features are well conserved in a distantly related tree pathogen, Heterobasidion annosum. Furthermore, the carbon source-dependent CAZyme secretions of P. fraxinea SS3 and a nonpathogenic and strong white-rot Polyporales member, Phanerochaete chrysosporium RP78, were compared by activity measurements and proteomic analyses. As seen in the genome comparisons, P. fraxinea SS3 exhibited higher pectin-degrading activities and higher laccase activities than P. chrysosporium RP78, which were attributed to the secretion of abundant glycoside hydrolase family 28 (GH28) pectinases and auxiliary activity family 1_1 (AA1_1) laccases, respectively. These enzymes are possibly related to fungal invasion into the tree lumens and the detoxification of tree defense substances. Additionally, P. fraxinea SS3 showed secondary cell wall degradation capabilities at the same level as that of P. chrysosporium RP78. Overall, this study suggested mechanisms for how this fungus can attack the cell walls of living trees as a serious pathogen and differs from other nonpathogenic white-rot fungi. IMPORTANCE Many studies have been done to understand the mechanisms underlying the degradation of plant cell walls of dead trees by wood decay fungi. However, little is known about how some of these fungi weaken living trees as pathogens. P. fraxinea belongs to the Polyporales, a group of strong wood decayers, and is known to aggressively attack and fell standing hardwood trees all over the world. Here, we report CAZymes potentially related to plant cell wall degradation and pathogenesis factors in a newly isolated fungus, P. fraxinea SS3, by genome sequencing in conjunction with comparative genomic and secretomic analyses. The present study provides insights into the mechanisms of the degradation of standing hardwood trees by the tree pathogen, which will contribute to the prevention of this serious tree disease.",Applied and environmental microbiology,,37098943,基因组学；木腐真菌；树木病原体；担子菌门；碳水化合物活性酶,,2023-04-26,10.1128/aem.00272-23,许多研究致力于理解木材腐朽真菌如何降解死亡树木细胞壁的机制，但关于某些真菌如何作为病原体削弱活树的研究却鲜有报道。*P. fraxinea* 属于多孔菌目，是一类强效木材分解者，已知在全球范围内对活立木硬木树种具有强烈的侵染和破坏能力。本文通过基因组测序结合比较基因组学和分泌组学分析，报告了一种新分离的真菌 *P. fraxinea* SS3 中潜在参与植物细胞壁降解和致病性的 CAZymes。本研究为理解树木病原体导致硬木树种腐烂的机制提供了重要见解，有助于预防这种严重的树木疾病。
