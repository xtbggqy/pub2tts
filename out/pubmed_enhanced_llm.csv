Genetics,《全球生物多样性框架》的一项关键行动是维持所有物种的遗传多样性，以保障其适应潜力。为实现这一目标，需要将一种致力于将基础研究成果转化为直接实际效益的转化思维应用于生物多样性保护。尽管关于基因组学对保护价值的讨论很多，但生成基因组资源的研究人员与将其应用于生物多样性管理的实践者之间仍然存在脱节。随着全球对非模式物种参考基因组构建工作的努力不断增加，对实用生物多样性应用的投资至关重要。理解种群和多物种多样性以及长期监测等应用需要得到支持，同时政策制定者也需要接受教育，以便将这些数据整合到基于证据的决策中。如果不进行这样的投资，利用基因组学彻底改变全球生物多样性保护的机会将无法完全实现。,Hogg Carolyn J,Translating genomic advances into biodiversity conservation.,genome,Q1,(Auto-generated) 基因组学;生物多样性保护;适应潜力;转化思维;参考基因组;政策制定者;纵向监测;生物信息学;分子生物学,将基因组学进展转化为生物多样性保护,"A key action of the new Global Biodiversity Framework is the maintenance of genetic diversity in all species to safeguard their adaptive potential. To achieve this goal, a translational mindset, which aims to convert results of basic research into direct practical benefits, needs to be applied to biodiversity conservation. Despite much discussion on the value of genomics to conservation, a disconnect between those generating genomic resources and those applying it to biodiversity management remains. As global efforts to generate reference genomes for non-model species increase, investment into practical biodiversity applications is critically important. Applications such as understanding population and multispecies diversity and longitudinal monitoring need support alongside education for policymakers on integrating the data into evidence-based decisions. Without such investment, the opportunity to revolutionize global biodiversity conservation using genomics will not be fully realized.",42.7,"School of Life & Environmental Sciences, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia. carolyn.hogg@sydney.edu.au.",0

It is evident that this diverse range of strategies results not only from a long evolutionary history, but is also of paramount importance for refining gene expression and metabolic modulation. This notion is particularly accurate for organisms that predominantly exhibit biochemical and physiological reactions with a lack of behavioural ones. Plants are a group of organisms that exhibit such features. Addressing unfavourable environmental conditions plays a pivotal role in plant physiology. This is particularly evident with the changing conditions of global warming and the irrevocable loss or depletion of natural ecosystems. In conceptual terms, the plant response to abiotic stress comprises a set of elaborate and intricate strategies. This is influenced by a range of abiotic factors that cause stressful conditions, and molecular genetic mechanisms that fine-tune metabolic pathways allowing the plant organism to overcome non-standard and non-optimal conditions. This review aims to focus on the current state of the art in the field of translational regulation in plants under abiotic stress conditions.

A transformative opportunity lies in exchanging genotype-to-phenotype knowledge between major crops (that is, those cultivated globally) and indigenous crops (that is, those locally cultivated within a circumscribed area)3-5 to enhance our food system. However, species-specific genetic variants and their interactions with desirable natural or engineered mutations pose barriers to achieving predictable phenotypic effects, even between related crops6,7. Here, by establishing a pan-genome of the crop-rich genus Solanum8 and integrating functional genomics and pan-genetics, we show that gene duplication and subsequent paralogue diversification are major obstacles to genotype-to-phenotype predictability. Despite broad conservation of gene macrosynteny among chromosome-scale references for 22 species, including 13 indigenous crops, thousands of gene duplications, particularly within key domestication gene families, exhibited dynamic trajectories in sequence, expression and function. By augmenting our pan-genome with African eggplant cultivars9 and applying quantitative genetics and genome editing, we dissected an intricate history of paralogue evolution affecting fruit size. The loss of a redundant paralogue of the classical fruit size regulator CLAVATA3 (CLV3)10,11 was compensated by a lineage-specific tandem duplication. Subsequent pseudogenization of the derived copy, followed by a large cultivar-specific deletion, created a single fused CLV3 allele that modulates fruit organ number alongside an enzymatic gene controlling the same trait. Our findings demonstrate that paralogue diversifications over short timescales are underexplored contingencies in trait evolvability.

We posit that another key and foundational role of effectors is niche establishment - specifically, the manipulation of plant physiological processes to enrich the apoplast in water and nutritive metabolites. Facets of plant immunity counteract niche establishment by restricting water, nutrients and signals for virulence activation. The complex competition to control and, in the case of pathogens, exploit the apoplast provides remarkable insights into the nature of virulence, host susceptibility, host defence and, ultimately, the origin of phytopathogenesis.

Advances in the field of pan genomics would facilitate the understanding of the clinical significance of such bacterial species previously thought to be among commensals paving the way for identifying new drug targets and control strategies. We constructed a pan-genome using 310 genome sequences of C. striatum. Pan-genome analysis was performed using three tools including Roary, PIRATE, and PEPPAN. AMR genes and virulence factors have been studied in relation to core genome phylogeny. Genomic Islands (GIs), Integrons, and Prophage regions have been explored in detail. The pan-genome ranges between a total of 5253-5857 genes with 2070 - 1899 core gene clusters. Some antimicrobial resistance genes have been identified in the core genome portion, but most of them were located in the dispensable genome. In addition, some well-known virulence factors described in pathogenic Corynebacterium species were located in the dispensable genome. A total of 115 phage species have been identified with only 44 intact prophage regions. This study presents a detailed comparative pangenome report of C. striatum. The species show a very slowly growing pangenome with relatively high number of genes in the core genome contributing to lower genomic variation. Prophage elements carrying AMR and virulence elements appear to be infrequent in the species. GIs appear to offer a prominent role in mobilizing antibiotic resistance genes in the species and integrons occur at a frequency of 50% in the species.

Nanoformulation of non-essential elements enhancing plant growth and stress tolerance also comes under the umbrella of NFs. NFs have an edge over conventional chemical fertilizers, viz., higher plant biomass and yield using much lesser fertilization, thereby reducing environmental pollution. Foliar and root applications of NFs lead to their successful uptake by the plant, depending on the size, surface charge, and other physicochemical properties of NFs. Smaller NFs can pass through channels on the waxy cuticle depending on the hydrophobicity, while larger NFs pass through the stomatal conduits of leaves. Charge-based adsorption, followed by apoplastic movement and endocytosis, translocates NFs through the root, while the size of NFs influences passage into vascular tissues. Recent transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies throw light on the molecular mechanisms of growth promotion by NFs. The expression levels of nutrient transporter genes are regulated by NFs, controlling uptake and minimizing excess nutrient toxicity. Accelerated growth by NFs is brought about by their extensive regulation of cell division, photosynthesis, carbohydrate, and nitrogen metabolism, as well as the phytohormone-dependent signaling pathways related to development, stress response, and plant defense. NFs mimic Ca,2+ eliciting second messengers and associated proteins in signaling cascades, reaching transcription factors and finally orchestrating gene expression to enhance growth and stress tolerance.

Cell walls are dynamic structures whose composition and integrity can be altered in response to environmental challenges and developmental cues. These wall changes are perceived by plant sensors/receptors to trigger adaptative responses during development and upon stress perception. Plant cell wall damage caused by pathogen infection, wounding, or other stresses leads to the release of wall molecules, such as carbohydrates (glycans), that function as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs are perceived by the extracellular ectodomains (ECDs) of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to activate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and disease resistance. Similarly, glycans released from the walls and extracellular layers of microorganisms interacting with plants are recognized as microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by specific ECD-PRRs triggering PTI responses. The number of oligosaccharides DAMPs/MAMPs identified that are perceived by plants has increased in recent years. However, the structural mechanisms underlying glycan recognition by plant PRRs remain limited. Currently, this knowledge is mainly focused on receptors of the LysM-PRR family, which are involved in the perception of various molecules, such as chitooligosaccharides from fungi and lipo-chitooligosaccharides (i.e., Nod/MYC factors from bacteria and mycorrhiza, respectively) that trigger differential physiological responses. Nevertheless, additional families of plant PRRs have recently been implicated in oligosaccharide/polysaccharide recognition. These include receptor kinases (RKs) with leucine-rich repeat and Malectin domains in their ECDs (LRR-MAL RKs), Catharanthus roseus RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1-LIKE group (CrRLK1L) with Malectin-like domains in their ECDs, as well as wall-associated kinases, lectin-RKs, and LRR-extensins. The characterization of structural basis of glycans recognition by these new plant receptors will shed light on their similarities with those of mammalians involved in glycan perception.

Here, we characterized a short-internode soybean mutant, reduced internode 1 (rin1). Partial loss of SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA 105 3a (SPA3a) underlies rin1. RIN1 physically interacts with two homologs of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), STF1 and STF2, to promote their degradation.

Vegetable oil, which is composed mainly of the storage lipid triacylglycerol, also has important applications in food, biofuel and oleochemical industries. Lipid biosynthesis occurs in multiple subcellular compartments and involves the coordinated action of various pathways. Although biochemical and molecular biology research over the last few decades has identified many proteins associated with lipid metabolism, our current understanding of the dynamic protein interactomes involved in lipid biosynthesis, modification and channelling is limited. This review examines advances in the identification and characterization of protein interactomes involved in plant lipid biosynthesis, with a focus on protein complexes consisting of different subunits for sequential reactions such as those in fatty acid biosynthesis and modification, as well as transient or dynamic interactomes formed from enzymes in cooperative pathways such as assemblies of membrane-bound enzymes for triacylglycerol biosynthesis. We also showcase a selection of representative protein interactome structures predicted using AlphaFold2, and discuss current and prospective strategies involving the use of interactome knowledge in plant lipid biotechnology.

Moreover, SA orchestrates a complex series of post-translational modifications of downstream signaling components and promotes the formation of biomolecular condensates that function as cellular signalling hubs.

Plants possess a sophisticated innate immunity system capable of detecting and responding to pathogen infection to prevent disease. Our understanding of this system has grown enormously over the past century. Early genetic descriptions of plant disease resistance and pathogen virulence were embodied in the gene-for-gene hypothesis, while physiological studies identified pathogen-derived elicitors that could trigger defense responses in plant cells and tissues. Molecular studies of these phenomena have now coalesced into an integrated model of plant immunity involving cell surface and intracellular detection of specific pathogen-derived molecules and proteins culminating in the induction of various cellular responses. Extracellular and intracellular receptors engage distinct signaling processes but converge on many similar outputs with substantial evidence now for integration of these pathways into interdependent networks controlling disease outcomes. Many of the molecular details of pathogen recognition and signaling processes are now known, providing opportunities for bioengineering to enhance plant protection from disease. Here we provide an overview of the current understanding of the main principles of plant immunity, with an emphasis on the key scientific milestones leading to these insights.",12.0,"Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Agriculture and Food, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",0

This ""noise"" in expression derives from several sources, including the genomic and cellular environment in which a gene resides. Large-scale maps of genomic environments have revealed the effects of epigenetic modifications and transcription factor occupancy on mean expression levels, but leveraging such maps to explain expression noise will require new methods to assay how expression noise changes at locations across the genome. To address this gap, we present Single-cell Analysis of Reporter Gene Expression Noise and Transcriptome (SARGENT), a method that simultaneously measures the noisiness of reporter genes integrated throughout the genome and the global mRNA profiles of individual reporter-gene-containing cells. Using SARGENT, we perform the first comprehensive genome-wide survey of how genomic locations impact gene expression noise. We find that the mean and noise of expression correlate with different histone modifications. We quantify the intrinsic and extrinsic components of reporter gene noise and, using the associated mRNA profiles, assign the extrinsic component to differences between the CD24+ ""stem-like"" substate and the more ""differentiated"" substate. SARGENT also reveals the effects of transgene integrations on endogenous gene expression, which will help guide the search for ""safe-harbor"" loci.

Noncoding RNAs can travel through not only plasmodesma and phloem but also intercellular barriers to regulate distinct processes. Increasing evidence shows that the intercellular trans-kingdom transmission of ncRNAs is able to modulate many important interactions between plants and other organisms, such as plant response to pathogen attack, the symbiosis between legume plants and rhizobia and the interactions with parasitic plants. In these interactions, plant ncRNAs are believed to be sorted into extracellular vesicles (EVs) or other nonvesicular vehicles to pass through cell barriers and trigger trans-kingdom RNA interference (RNAi) in recipient cells from different species. There is evidence that the features of extracellular RNAs and associated RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a role in defining the RNAs to retain in cell or secrete outside cells. Despite the few reports about RNA secretion pathway in plants, the export of extracellular ncRNAs is orchestrated by a series of pathways in plants.

Commonality in the genetic hardware of plants has enabled robust comparative genomics that has provided a broad picture of angiosperm evolution and implicated both general processes and specific elements in contributing to botanical diversity. We argue that the hardware of plant genomes-both in content and in dynamics-has been shaped by selection for rather substantial differences in gene regulation between plants and animals such as maize and human, organisms of comparable genome size and gene number. Their distinctive genome content and dynamics may reflect in part the indeterminate development of plants that puts strikingly different demands on gene regulation than in animals. Repeated polyploidization of plant genomes and multiplication of individual genes together with extensive rearrangement and differential retention provide rich raw material for selection of morphological and/or physiological variations conferring fitness in specific niches, whether natural or artificial.

P is primarily acquired in the form of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from soil. To cope with Pi deficiency, plants have evolved an elaborate system to improve Pi acquisition and utilization through an array of developmental and physiological changes, termed Pi starvation response (PSR). Plants also assemble and manage mutualistic microbes to enhance Pi uptake, through integrating PSR and immunity signaling. A trade-off between plant growth and defense favors the notion that plants lower a cellular state of immunity to accommodate host-beneficial microbes for nutrition and growth at the cost of infection risk. However, the existing data indicate that plants selectively activate defense responses against pathogens, but do not or less against non-pathogens, even under nutrient deficiency.

Gene clustering is complicated by intraspecific duplications and horizontal gene transfers that are frequent in prokaryotes. In consequence, gene clustering methods must deal with a trade-off between identifying vertically transmitted representatives of multicopy gene families, which are recognizable by synteny conservation, and retrieving complete sets of species-level orthologs. We studied the implications of adopting homology, orthology, or synteny conservation as formal criteria for gene clustering by performing comparative analyses of 125 prokaryotic pangenomes. Clustering criteria affect pangenome functional characterization, core genome inference, and reconstruction of ancestral gene content to different extents. Species-wise estimates of pangenome and core genome sizes change by the same factor when using different clustering criteria, allowing robust cross-species comparisons regardless of the clustering criterion. However, cross-species comparisons of genome plasticity and functional profiles are substantially affected by inconsistencies among clustering criteria. Such inconsistencies are driven not only by mobile genetic elements, but also by genes involved in defense, secondary metabolism, and other accessory functions. In some pangenome features, the variability attributed to methodological inconsistencies can even exceed the effect sizes of ecological and phylogenetic variables. Choosing an appropriate criterion for gene clustering is critical to conduct unbiased pangenome analyses.

Thus, viruses facilitate the release and degradation of dissolved organic matter in the ocean, which may lead to better ecosystem functioning by linking top-down to bottom-up control.

To obtain insights into accessory chromosome dynamics, we first constructed a chromosome similarity network using all-vs-all similarity mapping.

Some of these accessory chromosomes are host-specific and likely play a role in determining host range. Using a k-mer based approach, we further identified the presence of these accessory chromosomes in all available (581) F. oxysporum assemblies and corroborated the occurrence of host-specific accessory chromosomes. To further analyze the evolution of chromosomes in F. oxysporum, we constructed a pangenome variation graph per group of homologous chromosomes. This reveals that accessory chromosomes are composed of different stretches of accessory regions, and possibly rearrangements between accessory regions gave rise to these mosaic accessory chromosomes. Furthermore, we show that accessory chromosomes are likely horizontally transferred in natural populations.

Due to gravity, roots establish robust anchorage and shoot, which enables to photosynthesize. It sets optimum posture and develops plant architecture to efficiently use resources like water, nutrients, CO2, and gaseous exchange. Hence, gravitropism is crucial for crop productivity as well as for the growth of plants in challenging climate. Some SGR members are known to affect tiller and shoot angle, organ size, and inflorescence stem in plants. Although the SHOOT GRAVITROPISM (SGR) family plays a key role in regulating the fate of shoot gravitropism, little is known about its function compared to other proteins involved in gravity response in plant cells and tissues. Moreover, less information on the SGR family's physiological activities and biochemical responses in shoot gravitropism is available. This review scrutinizes and highlights the recent developments in shoot gravitropism and provides an outlook for future crop development, multi-application scenarios, and translational research to improve agricultural productivity. Plants have evolved multiple gene families specialized in gravitropic responses, of which the SGR family is highly significant. The SGR family regulates the plant's gravity response by regulating specific physiological and biochemical processes such as transcription, cell division, amyloplast sedimentation, endodermis development, and vacuole formation. Here, we analyze the latest discoveries in shoot gravitropism with particular attention to SGR proteins in plant cell biology, cellular physiology, and homeostasis. Plant cells detect gravity signals by sedimentation of amyloplast (starch granules) in the direction of gravity, and the signaling cascade begins. Gravity sensing, signaling, and auxin redistribution (organ curvature) are the three components of plant gravitropism. Eventually, we focus on the role of multiple SGR genes in shoot and present a complete update on the participation of SGR family members in gravity.",11.3,"Division of Life Science and Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Four), Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Gyeongnam, 52828, Republic of Korea.; Division of Life Science and Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Four), Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Gyeongnam, 52828, Republic of Korea.

But how genome-wide sequence divergence maps to species status is far from clear. While gene sequence divergence is commonly used to delineate bacterial species, its correspondence to established species boundaries has yet to be explored across eukaryotic taxa. Because the processes underlying gene flow differ fundamentally between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, these domains are likely to differ in the relationship between reproductive isolation and genome-wide sequence divergence. In prokaryotes, homologous recombination, the basis of gene flow, depends directly on the degree of genomic sequence divergence, whereas in sexually reproducing eukaryotes, reproductive incompatibility can stem from changes in very few genes. Guided by measures of genome-wide sequence divergence in bacteria, we gauge how genomic criteria correspond to species boundaries in eukaryotes. In recognized species of eukaryotes, levels of gene sequence divergence within species are typically very small, averaging 1% genome-wide sequence divergence are likely separate species, whereas prokaryotic populations with 1% divergence are still able to recombine and thus can be considered the same species.",11.1,"Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712.; Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712.",0

Although multiple studies describing PGs of various plant species have been published in recent years, a better understanding regarding the effect of the computational procedures used for PG construction could guide researchers in making more informed methodological decisions.

Some species have fluid pangenomes, with a high proportion of genes varying between individual genomes. Other species have less fluid pangenomes, with different genomes tending to contain the same genes. Two main hypotheses have been suggested to explain this variation: differences in species' bacterial lifestyle and effective population size. However, previous studies have not been able to test between these hypotheses because the different features of lifestyle and effective population size are highly correlated with each other, and phylogenetically conserved, making it hard to disentangle their relative importance. We used phylogeny-based analyses, across 126 bacterial species, to tease apart the causal role of different factors. We found that pangenome fluidity was lower in i) host-associated compared with free-living species and ii) host-associated species that are obligately dependent on a host, live inside cells, and are more pathogenic and less motile. In contrast, we found no support for the competing hypothesis that larger effective population sizes lead to more fluid pangenomes. Effective population size appears to correlate with pangenome variation because it is also driven by bacterial lifestyle, rather than because of a causal relationship.",11.1,"Department of Biology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SZ, United Kingdom.",0

The abundance of functional categories across genomes has previously been found to show power law scaling with respect to the total number of functional categories, suggesting that universal constraints shape genomic category abundance. Here, we look across the tree of life to understand how genome evolution may be related to functional scaling. We revisit previous observations of functional genome scaling with an expanded taxonomy by analyzing 3,726 bacterial, 220 archaeal, and 79 unicellular eukaryotic genomes. We find that for some functional classes, scaling is best described by multiple exponents, revealing previously unobserved shifts in scaling as genome-encoded protein annotations increase or decrease. Furthermore, we find that scaling varies between phyletic groups at both the domain and phyla levels and is less universal than previously thought. This variability in functional scaling is not related to taxonomic phylogeny resolved at the phyla level, suggesting that differences in cell plan or physiology outweigh broad patterns of taxonomic evolution. Since genomes are maintained and replicated by the functional proteins encoded by them, these results point to functional degeneracy between taxonomic groups and unique evolutionary trajectories toward these. We also find that individual phyla frequently span scaling exponents of functional classes, revealing that individual clades can move across scaling exponents.

This review accumulates substantial evidence that portrays ABA as a crucial regulatory hub, coordinating the complex network of plant antiviral immunity. It is capable of synchronizing resistance pathways, yet it can also be exploited as a susceptibility factor by viral effectors. ABA fortifies multi-layered defenses on one hand, by activating RNA silencing mechanisms that precisely degrade viral genomes, strengthening plasmodesmal gateways with callose barriers, and priming the transcriptional programs of resistance genes. On the other hand, ABA can augment susceptibility by counteracting other defense hormones, dampening oxidative bursts, and inhibiting antiviral defence proteins. Interestingly, a variety of viruses have independently evolved strategies to manipulate ABA signalling pathways. This fascinating paradigm of hormonal conflicts unveils ABA as an important regulatory handle that determines infection trajectories. Future studies should carefully explore the multifaceted impacts of ABA modulation on plant immunity and susceptibility to diverse pathogens before considering practical applications in viral resistance strategies.",9.7,"Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, 110021, India.; Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, 110021, India.

We then used these assemblies to explore the genome-scale landscape of allele-specific expression (ASE) and create a pangenome graph for pear. ASE was observed for close to 6000 genes in both hybrid cultivars. A subset of ASE genes related to aspects of fruit quality such as sugars, organic acids, and cuticular wax were identified, suggesting their important contributions to heterosis. Specifically, Ma1, a gene regulating fruit acidity, is absent in the paternal haplotypes of HXS and YLX. A pangenome graph was built based on our assemblies and seven published pear genomes. Resequencing data for 139 cultivated pear genotypes (including 97 genotypes sequenced here) were subsequently aligned to the pangenome graph, revealing numerous structural variant hotspots and selective sweeps during pear diversification. As predicted, the Ma1 allele was found to be absent in varieties with low organic acid content, and this association was functionally validated by Ma1 overexpression in pear fruit and calli. Overall, these results reveal the contributions of ASE to fruit-quality heterosis and provide a robust pangenome reference for high-resolution allele discovery and association mapping.",10.5,"National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement and Utilization, Sanya Institute of Nanjing Agricultural University, College of Horticulture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210095, China.; Pomology Institute, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, Shanxi 030801, China.; Department of Botany and Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement and Utilization, Sanya Institute of Nanjing Agricultural University, College of Horticulture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210095, China.

Our study reveals a nonuniform genome organization in 2 main regions: 1 concentrating core genes and another gene duplications. We also found that Pithoviridae genomes are more conservative than other families of giant viruses, with a low and stable proportion (5% to 7%) of genes originating from horizontal transfers. Genome size variation within the family is mainly due to variations in gene duplication rates (from 14% to 28%) and massive invasion by inverted repeats.

SEN-GENOME体现了以社区为导向的去中心化研究模式。通过严格的招募标准和伦理实践，该项目计划对塞内加尔14个行政区内的31个民族语言群体的1,000个基因组进行测序，推动针对该地区的本地化基因组研究。SEN-GENOME成功的关键在于其致力于本地化的数据治理、能力建设以及与非洲更广泛的泛基因组项目的整合。尽管数据标准化和共享存在复杂性，但我们的合作努力目标一致，确保朝着全面的人类泛基因组迈进的步伐稳步前行。我们诚邀并欢迎与其他研究机构的合作，共同实现这一愿景。

总之，像SEN-GENOME这样的本地倡议在弥合基因组差异方面发挥着关键作用，为实现公平包容的基因组学研究提供了途径。由共同健康愿景引导的协作努力将推动我们对人类基因组有更全面的理解，并通过基因组医学改善健康状况。",Gaye Amadou; Sene Andrea Regina G; Gadji Macoura; Deme Alioune; Cisse Aynina; Ndiaye Rokhaya,Toward building a comprehensive human pan-genome: The SEN-GENOME project.,genome,Q1,(Auto-generated) 人类泛基因组; 非洲基因组; 基因组多样性; 社区驱动研究; 数据本地治理; 能力建设; 基因组医学; 生物信息学; 分子生物学,SEN-GENOME项目,"The human reference genome (GRCh38), primarily sourced from individuals of European descent, falls short in capturing the vast genetic diversity across global populations. Efforts to diversify the reference genome face challenges in accessibility and representation, exacerbating the scarcity of African genomic data crucial for studying diseases prevalent in these populations. Sherman et al. proposed constructing reference genomes tailored to distinct human sub-populations. Their African Pan-Genome initiative highlighted substantial genetic variation missing from the GRCh38 human reference genome, emphasizing the necessity for population-specific genomes. In response, local initiatives like the Senegalese Genome project (SEN-GENOME) have emerged to document the genomes of historically overlooked populations. SEN-GENOME embodies community-driven decentralized research. With meticulous recruitment criteria and ethical practices, it aims to sequence 1,000 genomes from 31 ethnolinguistic groups, in the fourteen administrative regions of Senegal, fostering local genomic research tailored to the region. The key to SEN-GENOME's success is its commitment to local governance of data, capacity building, and integration with broader pan-genome projects in Africa. Despite the complexities of data harmonization and sharing, our collaborative efforts are aligned with common goals, ensuring steady progress toward a comprehensive human pan-genome. We invite and welcome collaboration with other research entities to achieve this shared vision. In summary, local initiatives such as SEN-GENOME are pivotal in bridging genomic disparities, offering pathways to equitable and inclusive genomic research.

These studies acknowledged the role of non-coding RNAs in modulating gene expression. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a kind of non-coding RNAs having lengths of >200 nucleotides, playing numerous roles in plant developmental processes such as photomorphogenesis, epigenetic changes, reproductive tissue development, and in regulating biotic and abiotic stresses. Epigenetic changes further control gene expression by changing their state to ""ON-OFF"" and also regulate stress memory and its transgenerational inheritance. With well-established regulatory mechanisms, they act as guides, scaffolds, signals, and decoys to modulate gene expression. They act as a major operator of post-transcriptional modifications such as histone and epigenetic modifications, and DNA methylations. The review elaborates on the roles of lncRNAs in plant immunity and also discusses how epigenetic markers alter gene expression in response to pest/pathogen attack and influences chromatin-associated stress memory as well as transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic imprints in plants.

Plant-endophyte interaction is a complex mechanism and is currently a focus of research to understand the underlying mechanism of endophyte asymptomatic colonization, the process of evading plant immune response, modulation of gene expression, and establishment of a balanced mutualistic relationship. Fungal endophytes rely on plant hosts for nutrients, shelter, and transmission and improve the host plant's tolerance against biotic stresses, including -herbivores, nematodes, bacterial, fungal, viral, nematode, and other phytopathogens. Endophytic fungi have been reported to improve plant health by reducing and eradicating the harmful effect of phytopathogens through competition for space or nutrients, mycoparasitism, and through direct or indirect defense systems by producing secondary metabolites as well as by induced systemic resistance (ISR). Additionally, for efficient crop improvement, practicing them would be a fruitful step for a sustainable approach.

Excess or deficient provision of metal/metalloids puts plant's life and survival at risk, thus considered a potent stress for plants. Chloroplasts as an organelle with a high metal demand form a pivotal site within the metal homeostasis network. Therefore, the metal-mediated electron transport chain (ETC) in chloroplasts is a primary target site of metal/metalloid-induced stresses. Both excess and deficient availability of metal/metalloids threatens plant's photosynthesis in several ways. Energy demands from the photosynthetic carbon reactions should be in balance with energy output of ETC. Malfunctioning of ETC components as a result of metal/metalloid stress initiates photoinhiition. A feedback inhibition from carbon fixation process also impedes the ETC. Metal stress impairs antioxidant enzyme activity, pigment biosynthesis, and stomatal function. However, genetic manipulations, nutrient management, keeping photostasis, and application of phytohormones are among strategies for coping with metal stress. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of metal/metalloid stress, as well as the exploration of potential strategies to mitigate its impact on plants are imperative.

In this perspective, we consider a possible role for discordance between gene trees and species trees in the interpretation of phylogenetic signal in studies of community ecology. Modern genomic data show that the evolutionary histories of many taxa are better described by a patchwork of histories that vary along the genome rather than a single species tree. If a subset of genomic loci harbour trait-related genetic variation, then the phylogeny at these loci may be more informative of interspecific trait differences than the genome background. We develop a simple method to detect loci harbouring phylogenetic signal and demonstrate its application through a proof-of-principle analysis of Penicillium genomes and pairwise interaction strength.

Chromium is very harmful to plants due to its effects on many physiological and metabolic pathways culminating in a negative impact on plant's growth, development, and ability to take up nutrients. Plants have developed physiological, biochemical, and molecular ways of defense against Cr, such as by augmenting antioxidant potential to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS). A number of genes have been discovered to play a significant role in the defense mechanisms of plants against Cr, for example, genes associated with the activation of phytochelatins, metallothioneins, and those of enzymes like glutathione-S-transferases. Along with this, a few miRNAs have been found to be associated in alleviating Cr stress and, to augment plant tolerance by controlling transcription factors, HSPs, and the expression of a few proteins and hormones. Defense pathway genes and miRNAs have been used for the generation of transgenic phytoremediator plants. Not only do the transgenic plants have a higher tolerance to Cr, but they also act as hyperaccumulators for Cr and have the potential to remediate other heavy metals. This article describes about environmental Cr contamination, Cr effects on plants, different genes and miRNAs involved in Cr stress mitigation and use of candidate genes, microRNAs for creating transgenic plant systems for phytoremediation, and the applications of CRISPR technology.

Homoeologous chromosomes (chromosomes with common shared ancestry) may undergo recombination immediately after allopolyploid formation and continue over successive generations. The outcome of this meiotic pairing behavior is dynamic and complex. Homoeologous exchanges (HEs) may lead to the formation of unbalanced gametes, reduced fertility, and selective disadvantage. By contrast, HEs could act as sources of novel evolutionary substrates, shifting the relative dosage of parental gene copies, generating novel phenotypic diversity, and helping the establishment of neo-allopolyploids. However, HE patterns vary among lineages, across generations, and even within individual genomes and chromosomes. The causes and consequences of this variation are not fully understood, though interest in this evolutionary phenomenon has increased in the last decade.

With belowground focus we systematically decomposed both of these directions into plant and (root and rhizosphere) microbiome components to identify methodological challenges and research priorities. We found that the bidirectionality of plant microbiome interactions presents a challenge for genetic studies. Establishing causality is particularly difficult when a plant mutant has both, an altered phenotype and an altered microbiome. Is the mutation directly affecting the microbiome (e.g., through root exudates), which then causes an altered phenotype of the plant and/or is the altered microbiome the consequence of the mutation altering the plant's phenotype (e.g., root architecture)? Here, we put forward that feedback experiments allow to separate cause and effect and furthermore, they are useful for investigating plant interactions with complex microbiomes in natural soils. They especially allow to investigate the plant genetic basis how plants respond to soil microbiomes and we stress that such microbiome feedbacks are understudied compared to the mechanisms contributing to microbiome assembly.

Recently proposed models yielded promising results for the task of genome sequence classification. Nevertheless, these models often ignore the sequential nature of nucleotides, which is crucial for revealing their underlying structure and function. To address this limitation, we present SPM4GAC, a sequential pattern mining (SPM)-based framework to analyze and classify the macromolecule genome sequences of viruses. First, a large dataset containing the genome sequences of various RNA viruses is developed and transformed into a suitable format. On the transformed dataset, algorithms for SPM are used to identify frequent sequential patterns of nucleotide bases. The obtained frequent sequential patterns of bases are then used as features to classify different viruses. Ten classifiers are employed, and their performance is assessed by using several evaluation measures.

To this aim, we define a mating model where the individual proportions of the genome inherited from Native American, European, and sub-Saharan African ancestral populations constrain the mating probabilities through ancestry-related assortative mating and sex bias parameters. We simulate a wide range of admixture scenarios under this model. Then, we train a deep neural network and retrieve good performance in predicting mating parameters from genomic data.

Ordered kurtosis was most effective in selecting informative signatures from a single genome, without requiring prior knowledge from other datasets. Among the three divergence measures evaluated, the two-sample t-test was the most successful, and a non-overlapping window with a small eye window (size 2) was best suited for identifying compositionally distinct regions.

Such heritable traits emerge in response to different environmental niches and can have a profound influence on microbial community dynamics. As a consequence, any individual genome or population will contain merely a fraction of the total genetic diversity of any operationally defined ""species"", whose ecological potential can thus be only fully understood by studying all of their genomes and the genes therein. This concept, known as the pangenome, is valuable for studying microbial ecology and evolution, as it partitions genomes into core (present in all the genomes from a species, and responsible for housekeeping and species-level niche adaptation among others) and accessory regions (present only in some, and responsible for intra-species differentiation). Here we present SuperPang, an algorithm producing pangenome assemblies from a set of input genomes of varying quality, including metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). SuperPang runs in linear time and its results are complete, non-redundant, preserve gene ordering and contain both coding and non-coding regions. Our approach provides a modular view of the pangenome, identifying operons and genomic islands, and allowing to track their prevalence in different populations. We illustrate this by analysing intra-species diversity in Polynucleobacter, a bacterial genus ubiquitous in freshwater ecosystems, characterized by their streamlined genomes and their ecological versatility.

Low oxygen stress has long been known to trigger changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels in plants, and recent work has seen some major steps forward in characterizing these events as part of a Ca2+-based signaling system through (1) defining how hypoxia may trigger and then shape the dynamics of these Ca2+ signals, and (2) identifying a host of the downstream elements that allow Ca2+ to regulate a wide-ranging network of hypoxia responses.

Yet, we usually need a suitable reference genome for mapping population-level resequencing data. In some model systems, multiple reference genomes are available, giving the challenging task of determining which reference genome best suits the data. Here, we compared the use of two different reference genomes for the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), one novel genome derived from a European gynogenetic individual and the published reference genome of a North American individual. Specifically, we investigated the impact of using a local reference versus one generated from a distinct lineage on several common population genomics analyses. Through mapping genome resequencing data of 60 sticklebacks from across Europe and North America, we demonstrate that genetic distance among samples and the reference genomes impacts downstream analyses. Using a local reference genome increased mapping efficiency and genotyping accuracy, effectively retaining more and better data. Despite comparable distributions of the metrics generated across the genome using SNP data (i.e. π, Tajima's D and FST ), window-based statistics using different references resulted in different outlier genes and enriched gene functions. A marker-based analysis of DNA methylation distributions had a comparably high overlap in outlier genes and functions, yet with distinct differences depending on the reference genome. Overall, our results highlight how using a local reference genome decreases reference bias to increase confidence in downstream analyses of the data.

This may adversely affect crop and other non-target plants because the plant's resilience and resistance largely rely on plant-associated microbes. Ubiquitous glyphosate residues in soil and how they impact mutualistic microbes inhabiting the aboveground plant parts are largely unexplored. We studied the effects of herbicide residues in soil on Epichloë sp., which are common endophytic symbionts inhabiting aerial parts of cool-season grasses. In this symbiosis, the obligate symbiont subsists entirely on its host plant, and in exchange, it provides alkaloids conferring resistance to herbivores for the host grass that invests little in its own chemical defence. We first show decreased growth of Epichloë endophytes in vitro when directly exposed to two concentrations of glyphosate or glyphosate-based herbicides. Second, we provide evidence for a reduction of Epichloë-derived, insect-toxic loline alkaloids in endophyte-symbiotic meadow fescue (F. pratensis) plants growing in soil with a glyphosate history. Plants were grown for 2 years in an open field site, and natural herbivore infestation was correlated with the glyphosate-mediated reduction of loline alkaloid concentrations. Our findings indicate that herbicides residing in soil not only affect rhizosphere microbiota but also aerial plant endophyte functionality, which emphasizes the destructive effects of glyphosate on plant symbiotic microbes, here with cascading effects on plant-pest insect interactions.",7.4,"Biodiversity Unit, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.; Food Chemistry and Food Development, Department of Life Technologies, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.; Department of Biology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.",0

While domestic animals tend to have complex routes of origin and migration, suggesting a possible omission of some population-specific sequences in the current reference genome. Conversely, the pangenome is a collection of all DNA sequences of a species that contains sequences shared by all individuals (core genome) and is also able to display sequence information unique to each individual (variable genome). The progress of pangenome research in humans, plants and domestic animals has proved that the missing genetic components and the identification of large structural variants (SVs) can be explored through pangenomic studies. Many individual specific sequences have been shown to be related to biological adaptability, phenotype and important economic traits. The maturity of technologies and methods such as third-generation sequencing, Telomere-to-telomere genomes, graphic genomes, and reference-free assembly will further promote the development of pangenome. In the future, pangenome combined with long-read data and multi-omics will help to resolve large SVs and their relationship with the main economic traits of interest in domesticated animals, providing better insights into animal domestication, evolution and breeding. In this review, we mainly discuss how pangenome analysis reveals genetic variations in domestic animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, chickens) and their impacts on phenotypes and how this can contribute to the understanding of species diversity.

This study presents the first yak pangenome obtained through the de novo assembly of 16 yak genomes. We discovered 290 Mb of nonreference sequences and 504 new genes. Our pangenome-wide presence and absence variation (PAV) analysis revealed 5,120 PAV-related genes, highlighting a wide range of variety-specific genes and genes with varying frequencies across yak populations. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on binary gene PAV data classified yaks into three new groups: wild, domestic, and Jinchuan. Moreover, we proposed a 'two-haplotype genomic hybridization model' for understanding the hybridization patterns among breeds by integrating gene frequency, heterozygosity, and gene PAV data. A gene PAV-GWAS identified a novel gene (BosGru3G009179) that may be associated with the multirib trait in Jinchuan yaks. Furthermore, an integrated transcriptome and pangenome analysis highlighted the significant differences in the expression of core genes and the mutational burden of differentially expressed genes between yaks from high and low altitudes. Transcriptome analysis across multiple species revealed that yaks have the most unique differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs (between high- and low-altitude regions), especially in the heart and lungs, when comparing high- and low-altitude adaptations.

Here, we construct a graph pangenome from 24 haplotype assemblies representing seven taurine cattle breeds to identify and characterize the white-head-associated locus for the first time based on long-read sequencing data and pangenome analyses. We introduce a pangenome-wide association mapping approach that examines assembly path similarities within the graph to reveal an association between two most likely serial alleles of a complex structural variant (SV) 66 kb upstream of KIT and facial depigmentation. The complex SV contains a variable number of tandemly duplicated 14.3 kb repeats, consisting of LTRs, LINEs, and other repetitive elements, leading to misleading alignments of short and long reads when using a linear reference. We align 250 short-read sequencing samples spanning 15 cattle breeds to the pangenome graph, further validating that the alleles of the SV segregate with head depigmentation. We estimate an increased count of repeats in Hereford relative to Simmental and other white-headed cattle breeds from the graph alignment coverage, suggesting a large under-assembly in the current Hereford-based cattle reference genome, which had fewer copies.

When mapping reads to a pangenome graph, prioritizing alignments that are consistent with the known haplotypes improves genotyping accuracy. However, the existing rigorous formulations for colinear chaining and alignment problems do not consider the haplotype paths in a pangenome graph. This often leads to spurious read alignments to those paths that are unlikely recombinations of the known haplotypes. In this paper, we develop novel formulations and algorithms for sequence-to-graph alignment and chaining problems. Inspired by the genotype imputation models, we assume that a query sequence is an imperfect mosaic of reference haplotypes. Accordingly, we introduce a recombination penalty in the scoring functions for each haplotype switch. First, we solve haplotype-aware sequence-to-graph alignment in [Formula: see text] time, where Q is the query sequence, E is the set of edges, and H is the set of haplotypes represented in the graph. To complement our solution, we prove that an algorithm significantly faster than [Formula: see text] is impossible under the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH). Second, we propose a haplotype-aware chaining algorithm that runs in [Formula: see text] time after graph preprocessing, where N is the count of input anchors. We then establish that a chaining algorithm significantly faster than [Formula: see text] is impossible under SETH. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented our chaining algorithm in the Minichain aligner. By aligning sequences sampled from the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to a pangenome graph of 60 MHC haplotypes, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better consistency with ground-truth recombinations compared with a haplotype-agnostic algorithm.",7.0,"Department of Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore Karnataka 560012, India.; Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080, USA.; Department of Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore Karnataka 560012, India; chirag@iisc.ac.in.",0

The garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus) is a small rodent that has experienced one of the most severe modern population declines in Europe. We present a high-quality haplotype-resolved reference genome for the garden dormouse, and combine comprehensive short and long-read transcriptomics data sets with homology-based methods to generate a highly complete gene annotation. Demographic history analysis of the genome reveal a sharp population decline since the last interglacial, indicating an association between colder climates and population declines before anthropogenic influence. Using our genome and genetic data from 100 individuals, largely sampled in a citizen-science project across the contemporary range, we conduct the first population genomic analysis for this species. We find clear evidence for population structure across the species' core Central European range.

Plants and microorganisms form complex interaction networks resulting in molecular signaling, nutrient exchange, and other distinct metabolic responses. In these networks, microbial partners influence growth and N use efficiency of plants either positively or negatively. Harnessing the beneficial effects of specific players within crop microbiomes is a promising strategy to counteract the emerging threats to human and planetary health due to the overuse of industrial N fertilizers. However, in addition to N-providing activities (e.g. the well-known symbiosis of legumes and Rhizobium spp.), other plant-microorganism interactions must be considered to obtain a complete picture of how microbial-driven N transformations might affect plant nutrition.

Nonneuronal cell types, including astrocytes, endothelial cells, microglia perivascular-macrophages, oligodendrocytes, and vascular and leptomeningeal cells, exhibit significant activation of quasi-prime-containing gene associations related to cancer, whereas simultaneously suppressing quasi-prime-containing genes are associated with cognitive, mental, and developmental disorders.

Ascorbate oxidase (AO) is a blue copper oxidase that is responsible for the oxidation of AsA with the concomitant production of water. For many decades, AO was erroneously postulated as an enzyme without any obvious advantage, as it decreases the AsA pool size and thus is expected to weaken plant stress resistance. It was only a decade ago that this perspective shifted towards the fundamental role of AO in orchestrating both AsA and oxygen levels by influencing the overall redox balance in the extracellular matrix. Consistent with its localization in the apoplast, AO is involved in cell expansion, division, resource allocation, and overall plant yield. An increasing number of transgenic studies has demonstrated that AO can also facilitate communication between the surrounding environment and the cell, as its gene expression is highly responsive to factors such as hormonal signaling, oxidative stress, and mechanical injury.

Although fungi and plants lack intermediate filaments, their dynamic structural network of actin filaments and microtubules regulates cell shape, division, polarity, and vesicular trafficking. However, the specialized functions of the cytoskeleton during plant-fungus interactions remain elusive. Recent reports demonstrate that the plant cytoskeleton responds to signal cues and pathogen invasion through remodeling, thereby coordinating immune receptor trafficking, membrane microdomain formation, aggregation of organelles, and transport of defense compounds. Emerging evidence also suggests that cytoskeleton remodeling further regulates host immunity by triggering salicylic acid signaling, reactive oxygen species generation, and pathogenesis-related gene expression. During host invasion, fungi undergo systematic cytoskeleton remodeling, which is crucial for successful host penetration and colonization. Furthermore, phytohormones act as an essential regulator of plant cytoskeleton dynamics and are frequently targeted by fungal effectors to disrupt the host's growth-defense balance.

Pangenome analysis predominantly leverages graph-based methods that require computationally intensive multiple genome alignments, do not scale to highly complex eukaryotic genomes, limit their scope to identifying structural variants (SVs), or incur bias by relying on a reference genome. Here, we present PanKmer, a toolkit designed for reference-free analysis of pangenome datasets consisting of dozens to thousands of individual genomes. PanKmer decomposes a set of input genomes into a table of observed k-mers and their presence-absence values in each genome. These are stored in an efficient k-mer index data format that encodes SNPs, INDELs, and SVs. It also includes functions for downstream analysis of the k-mer index, such as calculating sequence similarity statistics between individuals at whole-genome or local scales. For example, k-mers can be ""anchored"" in any individual genome to quantify sequence variability or conservation at a specific locus. This facilitates workflows with various biological applications, e.g. identifying cases of hybridization between plant species. PanKmer provides researchers with a valuable and convenient means to explore the full scope of genetic variation in a population, without reference bias.

Although phage therapy is one of promising strategies for dealing with MDR bacteria, the main challenges of phage therapeutics include accumulation of phage resistant mutations and acquisition of the phage defense systems. To systematically evaluate the impact of (pro)phages in shaping genetic and evolutionary diversity of S. maltophilia, we collected 166 S. maltophilia isolates from three hospitals in southern China to analyze its pangenome, virulence factors, prophage regions, and anit-viral immune systems. Pangenome analysis indicated that there are 1328 saturated core genes and 26961 unsaturated accessory genes in the pangenome, suggesting existence of highly variable parts of S. maltophilia genome. The presence of genes in relation to T3SS and T6SS mechanisms suggests the great potential to secrete toxins by the S. maltophilia population, which is contrary to the conventional notion of low-virulence of S. maltophilia. Additionally, we characterized the pan-immune system maps of these clinical isolates against phage infections and revealed the co-harboring of CBASS and anti-CBASS in some strains, suggesting a never-ending arms race and the co-evolutionary dynamic between bacteria and phages. Furthermore, our study predicted 310 prophage regions in S. maltophilia with high genetic diversity. Six viral defense systems were found to be located at specific position of the S. maltophilia prophage genomes, indicating potential evolution of certain site/region similar to bacterial 'defense islands' in prophage. Our study provides novel insights into the S. maltophilia pangenome in relation to phage-defense mechanisms, which extends our understanding of bacterial-phage interactions and might guide the application of phage therapy in combating S. maltophilia infections.",6.7,"School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, PR China.; Shenzhen Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Second Clinical Medical College (Shenzhen People's Hospital), Jinan University, Shenzhen, PR China; BGI Forensic, Shenzhen 518083, PR China; The First Affiliated Hospital (Shenzhen People's Hospital), Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, PR China.; School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, PR China; Key University Laboratory of Metabolism and Health of Guangdong, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, PR China.; Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518112, PR China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, PR China.

This review outlines the diverse mechanisms of light and temperature perception, and downstream signalling, with an emphasis on their integration and interconnection. Recent research has highlighted the regulation of thermomorphogenesis by photoreceptors and their downstream light signalling proteins under different light conditions, and circadian clock components at warm temperatures. Here, we comprehensively describe these studies and demonstrate their connection with plant developmental responses. We also explain how the gene signalling pathways of photomorphogenesis and thermomorphogenesis are interconnected with the heat stress response to mediate thermotolerance, revealing new avenues to manipulate plants for climate resilience. In addition, the role of sugars as signalling molecules between light and temperature signalling pathways is also highlighted.

Pangenome inference involves clustering genes from a set of genomes into gene families, enabling genome-wide association studies and evolutionary history analysis. The core genome represents gene families present in nearly all genomes and is required to infer a high-quality phylogeny. For species-level datasets, fast pangenome inference tools have been developed. However, tools applicable to more diverse datasets are currently slow and scale poorly. Here, we introduce SCARAP, a program containing three modules for comparative genomics analyses: a fast and scalable pangenome inference module, a direct core genome inference module, and a module for subsampling representative genomes. When benchmarked against existing tools, the SCARAP pan module proved up to an order of magnitude faster with comparable accuracy. The core module was validated by comparing its result against a core genome extracted from a full pangenome. The sample module demonstrated the rapid sampling of genomes with decreasing novelty. Applied to a dataset of over 31 000 Lactobacillales genomes, SCARAP showcased its ability to derive a representative pangenome. Finally, we applied the novel concept of gene fixation frequency to this pangenome, showing that Lactobacillales genes that are prevalent but rarely fixate in species often encode bacteriophage functions.

Novel genome sequence, circular genome and variable genome length led to nomenclature inconsistencies. Since vast knowledge has already accumulated in the past two decades with inconsistent nomenclature, the insights gained on a genome could not be easily extendable to other genomes. Therefore, the present study aims to perform comparative genomics studies in WSSV on uniform nomenclature. We have combined the standard mummer tool with custom scripts to develop missing regions finder (MRF) that documents the missing genome regions and coding sequences in virus genomes in comparison to a reference genome and in its annotation nomenclature. The procedure was implemented as web tool and in command-line interface. Using MRF, we have documented the missing coding sequences in WSSV and explored their role in virulence through application of phylogenomics, machine learning models and homologous genes. We have tabulated and depicted the missing genome regions, missing coding sequences and deletion hotspots in WSSV on a common annotation nomenclature and attempted to link them to virus virulence. It was observed that the ubiquitination, transcription regulation and nucleotide metabolism might be essentially required for WSSV pathogenesis; and the structural proteins, VP19, VP26 and VP28 are essential for virus assembly. Few minor structural proteins in WSSV would act as envelope glycoproteins. We have also demonstrated the advantage of MRF in providing detailed graphic/tabular output in less time and also in handling of low-complexity, repeat-rich and highly similar regions of the genomes using other virus cases. Pathogenic virus research benefits from tools that could directly indicate the missing genomic regions and coding sequences between isolates/strains. In virus research, the analyses performed in this study provides an advancement to find the differences between genomes and to quickly identify the important coding sequences/genomes that require early attention from researchers. To conclude, the approach implemented in MRF complements similarity-based tools in comparative genomics involving large, highly-similar, length-varying and/or inconsistently annotated viral genomes.",6.6,"Centre for Bioinformatics, Nutrition Genetics and Biotechnology Division, ICAR - Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture, 75, Santhome High Road, MRC Nagar, RA Puram, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600028, India.; Centre for Bioinformatics, Nutrition Genetics and Biotechnology Division, ICAR - Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture, 75, Santhome High Road, MRC Nagar, RA Puram, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600028, India.

In this research, we present CoreDetector, an easy-to-use general-purpose program that can align the core-genome sequences for a range of genome sizes and divergence levels. To illustrate the flexibility of CoreDetector, we conducted alignments of a large set of closely related fungal pathogen and hexaploid wheat cultivar genomes as well as more divergent fly and rodent species genomes. In all cases, compared to existing multiple genome alignment tools, CoreDetector exhibited improved flexibility, efficiency, and competitive accuracy in tested cases. CoreDetector was developed in the cross platform, and easily deployable, Java language. A packaged pipeline is readily executable in a bash terminal without any external need for Perl or Python environments.

Recent work has demonstrated that significant biases may be introduced into downstream phylogenetic analyses from processing genomic data; however, it remains unclear whether there are interactions among bioinformatic parameters or biases introduced through the choice of reference genome for sequence alignment and variant calling. We address these knowledge gaps by employing a combination of simulated and empirical data sets to investigate the extent to which the choice of reference genome in upstream bioinformatic processing of genomic data influences phylogenetic inference, as well as the way that reference genome choice interacts with bioinformatic filtering choices and phylogenetic inference method. We demonstrate that more stringent minor allele filters bias inferred trees away from the true species tree topology, and that these biased trees tend to be more imbalanced and have a higher center of gravity than the true trees. We find the greatest topological accuracy when filtering sites for minor allele count (MAC) >3-4 in our 51-taxa data sets, while tree center of gravity was closest to the true value when filtering for sites with MAC >1-2. In contrast, filtering for missing data increased accuracy in the inferred topologies; however, this effect was small in comparison to the effect of minor allele filters and may be undesirable due to a subsequent mutation spectrum distortion. The bias introduced by these filters differs based on the reference genome used in short read alignment, providing further support that choosing a reference genome for alignment is an important bioinformatic decision with implications for downstream analyses. These results demonstrate that attributes of the study system and dataset (and their interaction) add important nuance for how best to assemble and filter short-read genomic data for phylogenetic inference.",6.5,"School of Natural Resources & the Environment, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85719, USA.; Department of Biological Sciences, Tarleton State University, Stephenville, TX 76401, USA.; Department of Integrative Biology and W.K.

Plants have evolved intricate relationships with a diverse array of microorganisms inhabiting their roots, leaves, and other plant tissues. This microbiota mainly includes bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoans, and viruses, forming a dynamic and interconnected network within and around the plant. Through mutualistic or cooperative interactions, these microbes contribute to various aspects of plant health and development. The direct mechanisms of the plant microbiome include the enhancement of plant growth and development through nutrient acquisition. Microbes have the ability to solubilize essential minerals, fix atmospheric nitrogen, and convert organic matter into accessible forms, thereby augmenting the nutrient pool available to the plant. Additionally, the microbiome helps plants to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses, such as pathogen attacks and adverse environmental conditions, by priming the plant's immune responses, antagonizing phytopathogens, and improving stress tolerance. Furthermore, the plant microbiome plays a vital role in phytohormone regulation, facilitating hormonal balance within the plant. This regulation influences various growth processes, including root development, flowering, and fruiting. Microbial communities can also produce secondary metabolites, which directly or indirectly promote plant growth, development, and health. Understanding the functional potential of the plant microbiome has led to innovative agricultural practices, such as microbiome-based biofertilizers and biopesticides, which harness the power of beneficial microorganisms to enhance crop yields while reducing the dependency on chemical inputs. In the present review, we discuss and highlight research gaps regarding the plant microbiome and how the plant microbiome can be used as a source of single and synthetic bioinoculants for plant growth and health.",6.7,"Plant-Microbe Interaction Lab, Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh 221005, India.; Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University, Richmond, NSW 2753, Australia; Crop Research Centre, Oak Park, Carlow, Ireland.; CARAH ASBL, Rue Pal Pastur 11, Ath 7800, Belgium; China Beacons of Excellence Research and Innovation Institute (CBI), University of Nottingham Ningbo China, Ningbo 315000, China.; Department of Agricultural and Soil Engineering, Agricultural Science Center, Federal University of Piaui, Teresina, Pi, Brazil.; Federal University of Ceará, Soil Science Department, Soil Microbiology Laboratory, Fortaleza, Ceará 60020-181, Brazil.; Department of Civil and Environmental engineering, Yonsei University, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.; Center Agriculture Food Environment (C3A), University of Trento, Via Mach 1, San Michele all'Adige 38098, Italy; Research and Innovation center, Fondazione Edmund Mach, Via E.

Most available viral identification tools consider individual sequences to determine whether they are of viral origin. As a result of challenges in viral assembly, fragmentation of genomes can occur, and existing tools may recover incomplete genome fragments. Therefore, the identification and characterization of novel phage genomes remain a challenge, leading to the need of improved approaches for phage genome recovery. We introduce Phables, a new computational method to resolve phage genomes from fragmented viral metagenome assemblies. Phables identifies phage-like components in the assembly graph, models each component as a flow network, and uses graph algorithms and flow decomposition techniques to identify genomic paths. Experimental results of viral metagenomic samples obtained from different environments show that Phables recovers on average over 49% more high-quality phage genomes compared to existing viral identification tools.

Precisely, it first disentangles up to p normal distributions by analyzing k-mer frequencies in whole genome sequencing of the focal species. Second, it computes the sizes of genomic regions related to 1∼p (homologous) chromosome(s) using each respective curve fitting, from which it infers the full polyploid and average haploid genome size.

Aligning sequences to a graph is critical for pangenome-based resequencing. The seed-chain-extend heuristic works by finding short exact matches between a sequence and a graph. In this heuristic, colinear chaining helps identify a good cluster of exact matches that can be combined to form an alignment. Colinear chaining algorithms have been extensively studied for aligning two sequences with various gap costs, including linear, concave, and convex cost functions. However, extending these algorithms for sequence-to-graph alignment presents significant challenges. Recently, Makinen et al. introduced a sparse dynamic programming framework that exploits the small path cover property of acyclic pangenome graphs, enabling efficient chaining. However, this framework does not consider gap costs, limiting its practical effectiveness. We address this limitation by developing novel problem formulations and provably good chaining algorithms that support a variety of gap cost functions. These functions are carefully designed to enable fast chaining algorithms whose time requirements are parameterized in terms of the size of the minimum path cover. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared with existing aligners.

In this study, we present a pangenome analysis of 1,910 diverse Xanthomonas genomes, highlighting their evolutionary relationships, the distribution of virulence-associated genes across strains, and rates of horizontal gene transfer.

We also use these data to re-assign incorrectly classified strains to phylogenetically informed species designations and find evidence of both monophyletic host specificity and convergent evolution of phylogenetically distant strains to the same host. Finally, we explore the role of recombination in maintaining genetic cohesion within the Xanthomonas genus as a result of both ancestral and recent recombination events.

我们选择了73个高质量的完整水平基因组组装数据，并基于核心基因比对重构了相应的泛基因组和参考系统发育树。为了找到最佳分析流程，我们测试了当前的泛基因组工具并获得了多个系统发育推断结果。泛基因组的辅助成分丰富，并根据Heaps定律被认为是开放的。随后，我们应用了全基因组关联分析方法（pan-GWAS），预测了与三类宿主（即人类、昆虫和植物）相关的正向关联基因簇。

结果显示，与人类感染相关的显著因子包括转录调节因子、脂蛋白、ABC转运蛋白和膜蛋白。而昆虫宿主偏好则与多种酶相关，例如水解酶、异香草酸酶和乙酰转移酶，其中后者可能具有神经毒性作用。植物感染可能通过VI型分泌系统以及调控植物细胞壁合成来实现。有趣的是，与植物相关的因子还包括一些潜在的促生长蛋白，如参与异生物质降解并释放铵离子的酶。此外，我们还识别了特异性因子集中过表达的功能注释，并发现其功能特性分为不同的集群，这表明宿主适应性由不同的功能通路代表。最后，我们发现移动遗传元件携带了特异性决定因子。具体而言，前噬菌体主要与与人类相关的因子相关联，而基因岛分别与昆虫和植物相关联。

It, however, was shown to infect a wide range of hosts apart from vertebrates such as insects or plants as well, being either pathogenic or growth-promoting for the latter. Despite being extensively studied in terms of virulence mechanisms during human infections, there has been little evidence of which factors determine S. marcescens host specificity. On that account, we analyzed S. marcescens pangenome to reveal possible specificity factors. We selected 73 high-quality genome assemblies of complete level and reconstructed the respective pangenome and reference phylogeny based on core genes alignment. To find an optimal pipeline, we tested current pangenomic tools and obtained several phylogenetic inferences. The pangenome was rich in its accessory component and was considered open according to the Heaps' law. We then applied the pangenome-wide associating method (pan-GWAS) and predicted positively associated gene clusters attributed to three host groups, namely, humans, insects, and plants. According to the results, significant factors relating to human infections included transcriptional regulators, lipoproteins, ABC transporters, and membrane proteins. Host preference toward insects, in its turn, was associated with diverse enzymes, such as hydrolases, isochorismatase, and N-acetyltransferase with the latter possibly exerting a neurotoxic effect. Finally, plant infection may be conducted through type VI secretion systems and modulation of plant cell wall synthesis. Interestingly, factors associated with plants also included putative growth-promoting proteins like enzymes performing xenobiotic degradation and releasing ammonium irons. We also identified overrepresented functional annotations within the sets of specificity factors and found that their functional characteristics fell into separate clusters, thus, implying that host adaptation is represented by diverse functional pathways. Finally, we found that mobile genetic elements bore specificity determinants. In particular, prophages were mainly associated with factors related to humans, while genetic islands-with insects and plants, respectively.

Here, we performed comparative genomic analyses of P.b and compared their pan-genomic features and virulence coding profiles to those of P.s. Our results revealed that P.b has a more plastic pangenome, a larger genome size, and a higher GC content than P.s. Interestingly, the P.b and P.s share similar core-genomic functions, but P.b encodes more functions in nutrient metabolism and energy conversion and fewer functions in host defense in their accessory-genomes. The P.b may initiate extracellular infection processes similar to those of P.s and Clostridium perfringens by encoding three toxin homologs (i.e., microbial collagenase, thiol-activated cytolysin, phospholipase C, which are involved in extracellular matrices degradation and membrane damaging) in their core-genomes. However, P.b is less toxic than the P.s by encoding fewer secretion toxins in the core-genome and fewer lethal toxins in the accessory-genome. Notably, P.b carries more toxins genes in their accessory-genomes, particularly those of plasmid origin. Moreover, three within-species and highly conserved plasmid groups, encoding virulence, gene acquisition, and adaptation, were carried by 25-33% of P.b strains and clustered by isolation source rather than geography. This study characterized the pan-genomic virulence features of P.b for the first time, and revealed that P. bifermentans is an emerging pathogen that can threaten human health in many aspects, emphasizing the importance of phenotypic and genomic characterizations of in situ clinical isolates.",5.6,"Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.; Marshall Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.; College of Chemistry and Environmental Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.",0

Biotic stress strongly affects plant cells' primary metabolism, including photosynthesis and respiration, the main source of energy and carbon skeletons for plant growth, development, and defence. Although the nature of photosynthetic limitations imposed by pathogens is variable, infection often increases photorespiratory pressure, generating conditions that promote ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate oxygenation, leading to a metabolic shift from assimilation to photorespiration. Photorespiration, the significant metabolic flux following photosynthesis, protects the photosynthetic apparatus from photoinhibition. However, recent studies reveal that its role is far beyond photoprotection. The intermediates of the photorespiratory cycle regulate photosynthesis, and photorespiration interacts with the metabolic pathways of nitrogen and sulphur, shaping the primary metabolism for stress responses.

To explain this phenomenon, a comprehensive pathogenomic and phenomic characterisation of P. betavasculorum species was performed. Genomes of P. betavasculorum strains isolated from potato, sunflower, and artichoke were sequenced and compared with those from sugar beet isolates. Metabolic profiling and pathogenomic analyses were conducted to assess virulence determinants and adaptation potential.

The plant nutritional status might influence disease resistance by strengthening or weakening plant immune responses, as well as through modulation of the pathogenicity program in the pathogen. Here, we discuss advances in our understanding of interactions between nutrient stress, deficiency or excess, and immune signaling pathways in the context of current agricultural practices. The introduction of chemical fertilizers and pesticides was a major component of the Green Revolution initiated in the 1960s that greatly boosted crop production. However, the massive application of agrochemicals also has adverse consequences on the environment and animal/human health.

Both tandem and segmental duplication events played a significant role in the expansion of the CNL gene family. These genes contain cis-elements related to light, stress, hormone, and development. The analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) revealed that MiCNL proteins interacted with other defense-responsive proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that MiCNL genes play a role in defense mechanisms within the organism.

While CIPKs act as serine/threonine protein kinases, transmitting calcium signals, CBLs function as calcium sensors, influencing the plant's response to abiotic stress.

Here, we constructed a pangenome for diploid A-genome cotton using 344 accessions from representative geographical regions, including 223 from China as the main component. We found 511 Mb of non-reference sequences (NRSs) and revealed the presence of 5479 previously undiscovered protein-coding genes. Our comprehensive approach enabled us to decipher the genetic underpinnings of the distinct geographic distributions of cotton. Notably, we identified 3301 presence-absence variations (PAVs) that are closely tied to gene expression patterns within the pangenome, among which 2342 novel expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) were found residing in NRSs. Our investigation also unveiled contrasting patterns of transposon proliferation between diploid and tetraploid cotton, with long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons exhibiting a synchronized surge in polyploids.

Our knowledge of this phenomenon among free-living bacteria remains scarce. We address the dynamics and limits of genome reduction by examining one of the most abundant bacteria in the ocean, the SAR86 clade. Despite its abundance, comparative genomics has been limited by the absence of pure cultures and the poor representation in metagenome-assembled genomes. We co-assembled multiple previously available single-amplified genomes to obtain the first complete genomes from members of the four families. All families showed a convergent evolutionary trajectory with characteristic features of streamlined genomes, most pronounced in the TMED112 family. This family has a genome size of ca. 1 Mb and only 1 bp as median intergenic distance, exceeding values found in other abundant microbes such as SAR11, OM43 and Prochlorococcus. This genomic simplification led to a reduction in the biosynthesis of essential molecules, DNA repair-related genes, and the ability to sense and respond to environmental factors, which could suggest an evolutionary dependence on other co-occurring microbes for survival (Black Queen hypothesis). Therefore, these reconstructed genomes within the SAR86 clade provide new insights into the limits of genome reduction in free-living marine bacteria.",5.1,"Evolutionary Genomics Group, Departamento Producción Vegetal y Microbiología, Universidad Miguel Hernández, Alicante, Spain.; Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, USA.; National Center for Integrated Coastal Research, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, USA.",0

Among the three European clades, a lineage associated with the wild arboreal niche is sister to the two other lineages that are linked to anthropic environments, one to wine fermentations and the other to diverse sources including dairy products and bread dough (Mix-Anthropic clade). Using 64 genomes we assembled the pangenome and the variable genome of T. delbrueckii. A comparison with Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that the weight of the variable genome in the pangenome of T. delbrueckii is considerably smaller. An association of gene content and ecology supported the hypothesis that the Mix-Anthropic clade has the most specialized genome and indicated that some of the exclusive genes were implicated in galactose and maltose utilization. More detailed analyses traced the acquisition of a cluster of GAL genes in strains associated with dairy products and the expansion and functional diversification of MAL genes in strains isolated from bread dough. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, domestication in T. delbrueckii is not primarily driven by alcoholic fermentation but rather by adaptation to dairy and bread-production niches.

We review the role of SVs in shaping phenotypes in avian model systems, and identify some general patterns in SV type, length and their associated traits. We found that most of the avian SVs so far identified are short indels in chickens, which are frequently associated with changes in body weight and plumage colouration. Overall, we found that relatively short SVs are more frequently detected, likely due to a combination of their prevalence compared to large SVs, and a detection bias, stemming primarily from the widespread use of short-read sequencing and associated analytical methods. SVs most commonly involve non-coding regions, especially introns, and when patterns of inheritance were reported, SVs associated primarily with dominant discrete traits. We summarise several examples of phenotypic convergence across different species, mediated by different SVs in the same or different genes and different types of changes in the same gene that can lead to various phenotypes. Complex rearrangements and supergenes, which can simultaneously affect and link several genes, tend to have pleiotropic phenotypic effects. Additionally, SVs commonly co-occur with single-nucleotide polymorphisms, highlighting the need to consider all types of genetic changes to understand the basis of phenotypic traits. We end by summarising expectations for when long-read technologies become commonly implemented in non-model birds, likely leading to an increase in SV discovery and characterisation.

Although there has been some progress in the phylogeny of Chrysosplenium over the years, the phylogenetic position of some species is still controversial. In this study, we assembled chloroplast genomes (cp genomes) of 34 Chrysosplenium species and performed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses in combination with other cp genomes of previously known Chrysosplenium species, for a total of 44 Chrysosplenium species. The comparative analyses revealed that cp genomes of Chrysosplenium species were more conserved in terms of genome structure, gene content and arrangement, SSRs, and codon preference, but differ in genome size and SC/IR boundaries. Phylogenetic analysis showed that cp genomes effectively improved the phylogenetic support and resolution of Chrysosplenium species and strongly supported Chrysosplenium species as a monophyletic taxon and divided into three branches. The results also showed that the sections of Alternifolia and Oppositifolia were not monophyletic with each other, and that C. microspermum was not clustered with other Chrysosplenium species with alternate leaves, but with C. sedakowii into separate branches. In addition, we identified 10 mutational hotspot regions that could serve as potential DNA barcodes for Chrysosplenium species identification. In contrast to Peltoboykinia, the clpP and ycf2 genes of Chrysosplenium were subjected to positive selection and had multiple significant positive selection sites. We further detected a significant positive selection site on the petG gene between the two sections of Chrysosplenium.

Imazethapyr, a widely utilized imidazolinone herbicide, has a long-lasting presence in the soil-plant system and can induce toxicity in non-target plants. However, the effects of imazethapyr on mineral nutrient homeostasis remain poorly comprehended. In this study, Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to concentrations of 4 and 10 μg/L imazethapyr showed noticeable reductions in shoot development and displayed a distinct dark purple color, which is commonly associated with phosphorus (P) deficiency in crops. Additionally, the total P content in both the shoots and roots of Arabidopsis significantly decreased following imazethapyr treatment when compared to the control groups. Through the complementary use of physiological and molecular analyses, we discovered that imazethapyr hinders the abundance and functionality of inorganic phosphorus (Pi) transporters and acid phosphatase. Furthermore, imazethapyr impairs the plant's Pi-deficiency adaptation strategies, such as inhibiting Pi transporter activities and impeding root hair development, which ultimately exacerbate P starvation. These results provide compelling evidence that residues of imazethapyr have the potential to disrupt plant P homeostasis and acquisition strategies. These findings offer valuable insights for risk assessment and highlight the need to reconsider the indiscriminate use of imazethapyr, particularly under specific scenarios such as nutrient deficiency.",4.7,"MOE Key Laboratory of Environment Remediation and Ecological Health, College of Natural Resource & Environmental Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, PR China.; Key Laboratory of Pollution Exposure and Health Intervention of Zhejiang Province, Interdisciplinary Research Academy (IRA), Zhejiang Shuren University, Hangzhou 310015, PR China.

Using one of the most extensively characterized genera, Coccolithovirus, as a case study, we combined pangenome analysis, multiple functional annotation tools, AlphaFold structural modeling, and literature analysis to compare the core and accessory pangenome and assess support for novel functional predictions. We determined that the Coccolithovirus pangenome shares 30% of its genes with all 14 strains, making up the core. Notably, 34% of its genes were found in at most three strains. Core genes were enriched in early expression based on a transcriptomic dataset of Coccolithovirus EhV-201 algal infection, were more likely to be similar to host proteins than the non-core set, and were more likely to be involved in vital functions such as replication, recombination, and repair. In addition, we generated and collated annotations for the EhV representative EhV-86 from 12 different annotation sources, building up information for 142 previously hypothetical and putative membrane proteins.

Fifty-one unique C. ureolyticus isolates were identified between January 2010 and August 2022, mostly originating from abscesses and blood cultures. To clarify the taxonomic relationships between isolates and to attribute specific genes with different clinical manifestations, we sequenced 19 available isolates from a variety of clinical specimen types and conducted a pangenomic analysis with publicly available C. ureolyticus genomes. Digital DNA:DNA hybridization suggested that these C. ureolyticus comprised a species complex of 10 species clusters (SCs) and several subspecies clusters. Although some orthologous genes or gene functions were enriched in isolates found in different SCs and clinical specimens, no association was significant. Nearly a third of the isolates possessed antimicrobial resistance genes, including the ermA resistance gene, potentially conferring resistance to macrolides, the treatment of choice for severe human campylobacteriosis.

It encompasses the objectives of preserving the environment, fostering economic growth, and promoting socioeconomic equality. To achieve sustainable development for humanity, it is imperative to prioritize sustainable agriculture. One significant approach to achieving this transition is the extensive utilization of microbes, which play a crucial role due to the genetic reliance of plants on the beneficial functions provided by symbiotic microbes. This review focuses on the significance of rhizospheric microbial communities, also known as the rhizomicrobiome (RM). It is a complex community of microorganisms that live in the rhizosphere and influence the plant's growth and health. It provides its host plant with various benefits related to plant growth, including biocontrol, biofertilization, phytostimulation, rhizoremediation, stress resistance, and other advantageous properties. Yet, the mechanisms by which the RM contributes to sustainable agriculture remain largely unknown. Investigating this microbial population presents a significant opportunity to advance toward sustainable agriculture. Hence, this study aims to provide an overview of the diversity and applications of RM in sustainable agriculture practices. Lately, there has been growing momentum in various areas related to rhizobiome research and its application in agriculture. This includes rhizosphere engineering, synthetic microbiome application, agent-based modeling of the rhizobiome, and metagenomic studies.

Numerous tools exist to annotate genes, gene clusters, mobile genetic elements, and other diverse features. However, these tools and pipelines can be difficult to install and run, be specialized for a particular element or feature, or lack annotations for larger elements that provide important genomic context. Integrating results across analyses is also important for understanding gene function. To address these challenges, we present the Beav annotation pipeline. Beav is a command-line tool that automates the annotation of bacterial genome sequences, mobile genetic elements, molecular systems and gene clusters, key regulatory features, and other elements. Beav uses existing tools in addition to custom models, scripts, and databases to annotate diverse elements, systems, and sequence features. Custom databases for plant-associated microbes are incorporated to improve annotation of key virulence and symbiosis genes in agriculturally important pathogens and mutualists. Beav includes an optional Agrobacterium-specific pipeline that identifies and classifies oncogenic plasmids and annotates plasmid-specific features. Following the completion of all analyses, annotations are consolidated to produce a single comprehensive output. Finally, Beav generates publication-quality genome and plasmid maps. Beav is on Bioconda and is available for download at https://github.com/weisberglab/beav. Annotation of genome features, such as the presence of genes and their predicted function, or larger loci encoding secretion systems or biosynthetic gene clusters, is necessary for understanding the functions encoded by an organism. Genomes can also host diverse mobile genetic elements, such as integrative and conjugative elements and/or phages, that are often not annotated by existing pipelines. These elements can horizontally mobilize genes encoding for virulence, antimicrobial resistance, or other adaptive functions and alter the phenotype of an organism. We developed a software pipeline, called Beav, that combines new and existing tools for the comprehensive annotation of these and other major features. Existing pipelines often misannotate loci important for virulence or mutualism in plant-associated bacteria. Beav includes custom databases and optional workflows for the improved annotation of plant-associated bacteria. Beav is designed to be easy to install and run, making comprehensive genome annotation broadly available to the research community.",4.8,"Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, USA.",0

Certain fungal pathogens colonize various body cavities, leading to life-threatening bloodstream infections. However, the identification and characterization of fungal isolates in laboratories remain a significant diagnostic challenge in medicine and public health. Whole-genome sequencing provides an unbiased and uniform identification pipeline for fungal pathogens but most bioinformatic analysis pipelines focus on prokaryotic species. To this end, TheiaEuk_Illumina_PE_PHB (TheiaEuk) was designed to focus on genomic analysis specialized to fungal pathogens. TheiaEuk was designed using containerized components and written in the workflow description language (WDL) to facilitate deployment on the cloud-based open bioinformatics platform Terra. This species-agnostic workflow enables the analysis of fungal genomes without requiring coding, thereby reducing the entry barrier for laboratory scientists. To demonstrate the usefulness of this pipeline, an ongoing outbreak of C. auris in southern Nevada was investigated. We performed whole-genome sequence analysis of 752 new C. auris isolates from this outbreak. Furthermore, TheiaEuk was utilized to observe the accumulation of mutations in the FKS1 gene over the course of the outbreak, highlighting the utility of TheiaEuk as a monitor of emerging public health threats when combined with whole-genome sequencing surveillance of fungal pathogens. A primary result of this work is a curated fungal database containing 5,667 unique genomes representing 245 species. TheiaEuk also incorporates taxon-specific submodules for specific species, including clade-typing for Candida auris (C. auris). In addition, for several fungal species, it performs dynamic reference genome selection and variant calling, reporting mutations found in genes currently associated with antifungal resistance (FKS1, ERG11, FUR1).

When combined with metagenomics, namely for human microbiome composition analysis, gene-oriented pangenome detection becomes a promising method to decipher ecosystem functions and population-level evolution. Established computational tools are able to investigate the genetic content of isolates for which a complete genomic sequence is available. However, there is a plethora of incomplete genomes that are available on public resources, which only a few tools may analyze. Incomplete means that the process for reconstructing their genomic sequence is not complete, and only fragments of their sequence are currently available. However, the information contained in these fragments may play an essential role in the analyses. Here, we present PanDelos-frags, a computational tool which exploits and extends previous results in analyzing complete genomes. It provides a new methodology for inferring missing genetic information and thus for managing incomplete genomes. PanDelos-frags outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in reconstructing gene families in synthetic benchmarks and in a real use case of metagenomics.

Ammonium is oxidized to nitrate by nitrifiers, but roots can release biological nitrification inhibitors (BNIs). Under what conditions does root-exudation of BNIs facilitate nitrogen N uptake and reduce pollution by N loss to the environment? We modeled the spatial-temporal dynamics of nitrifiers, ammonium, nitrate, and BNIs around a root and simulated root N uptake and net rhizosphere N loss over the plant's life cycle. We determined the sensitivity of N uptake and loss to variations in the parameter values, testing a broad range of soil-plant-microbial conditions, including concentrations, diffusion, sorption, nitrification, population growth, and uptake kinetics. An increase in BNI exudation reduces net N loss and, under most conditions, increases plant N uptake. BNIs decrease uptake in the case of (1) low ammonium concentrations, (2) high ammonium adsorption to the soil, (3) rapid nitrate- or slow ammonium uptake by the plant, and (4) a slowly growing or (5) fast-declining nitrifier population. Bactericidal inhibitors facilitate uptake more than bacteriostatic ones. Some nitrification, however, is necessary to maximize uptake by both ammonium and nitrate transporter systems. An increase in BNI exudation should be co-selected with improved ammonium uptake. BNIs can reduce N uptake, which may explain why not all species exude BNIs but have a generally positive effect on the environment by increasing rhizosphere N retention.",4.6,"Institute of Bio- and Geosciences-Plant Sciences (IBG-2), Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, 52425, Jülich, Germany. c.kuppe@fz-juelich.de.; Faculty 1, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany. c.kuppe@fz-juelich.de.; Institute of Bio- and Geosciences-Plant Sciences (IBG-2), Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, 52425, Jülich, Germany.",0

However, these methods have limitations, potentially resulting in imprecise predictions owing to incomplete coverage of AMR mechanisms and genetic variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a pan-genome-based machine learning approach to advance our understanding of AMR gene repertoires and uncover possible feature sets for precise AMR classification. By building compacted de Brujin graphs (cDBGs) from thousands of genomes and collecting the presence/absence patterns of unique sequences (unitigs) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we determined that using machine learning models on unitig-centered pan-genomes showed significant promise for accurately predicting the antibiotic resistance or susceptibility of microbial strains. Applying a feature-selection-based machine learning algorithm led to satisfactory predictive performance for the training dataset (with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of > 0.929) and an independent validation dataset (AUC, approximately 0.77). Furthermore, the selected unitigs revealed previously unidentified resistance genes, allowing for the expansion of the resistance gene repertoire to those that have not previously been described in the literature on antibiotic resistance. These results demonstrate that our proposed unitig-based pan-genome feature set was effective in constructing machine learning predictors that could accurately identify AMR pathogens. Gene sets extracted using this approach may offer valuable insights into expanding known AMR genes and forming new hypotheses to uncover the underlying mechanisms of bacterial AMR.",4.4,"Graduate Institute of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Business Administration, College of Management, Lunghwa University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.; Professional Master Program in Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Clinical Big Data Research Center, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.; TMU Research Center for Digestive Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.",0

A machine learning linear model trained on all the genetic variants derived from the pangenome and controlling for population structure reveals similar differences in VAGs, discovers new variants associated with pathogenicity (capacity to cause BSI), and accurately classifies BSI vs. commensal strains. Pathogenicity is a highly heritable trait, with up to 69% of the variance explained by bacterial genetic variants.

We offer a systematic guide and discuss the tools available for constructing a pangenome and conducting downstream analyses. Alfalfa, a highly heterozygous, cross pollinated and autotetraploid forage crop species, is used as an example to discuss the concerns and challenges offered by polyploid crop species. We conducted a comparative analysis using linear and graph-based methods by constructing an alfalfa graph pangenome using three publicly available genome assemblies. To illustrate the intricacies captured by pangenome graphs for a complex crop genome, we used five different gene sequences and aligned them against the three graph-based pangenomes. The comparison of the three graph pangenome methods reveals notable variations in the genomic variation captured by each pipeline. Pangenome resources are proving invaluable by offering insights into core and dispensable genes, novel gene discovery, and genome-wide patterns of variation. Developing user-friendly online portals for linear pangenome visualization has made these resources accessible to the broader scientific and breeding community. However, challenges remain with graph-based pangenomes including compatibility with other tools, extraction of sequence for regions of interest, and visualization of genetic variation captured in pangenome graphs. These issues necessitate further refinement of tools and pipelines to effectively address the complexities of polyploid, highly heterozygous, and cross-pollinated species.",4.4,"Department of Horticultural Science, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, 55108, USA. kaurh@umn.edu.; Department of Horticultural Science, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, 55108, USA.; USDA-ARS, Plant Science Research Unit, St. Paul, MN, 55108, USA.",0

MAIN: The environment influences an organism's genome through ambient factors in the biosphere (e.g. climate and UV radiation), as well as the agents it comes into contact with, i.e. the epigenetic and mutagenic effects of inanimate chemicals and pollution, and pathogenic organisms. Emerging scientific consensus is that social determinants of health, environmental conditions and genetic factors work together to influence the risk of many complex illnesses. That paradigm can also explain the environmental and ecological determinants of health as factors that underlie the (un)healthy ecosystems on which communities rely. We suggest that The Ecological Genome Project is an aspirational opportunity to explore connections between the human genome and nature. We propose consolidating a view of Ecogenomics to provide a blueprint to respond to the environmental challenges that societies face. This can only be achieved by interdisciplinary engagement between genomics and the broad field of ecology and related practice of conservation. In this respect, the One Health approach is a model for environmental orientated work. The idea of Ecogenomics-a term that has been used to relate to a scientific field of ecological genomics-becomes the conceptual study of genomes within the social and natural environment. The HUGO Committee on Ethics, Law and Society (CELS) recommends that an interdisciplinary One Health approach should be adopted in genomic sciences to promote ethical environmentalism.

Kutzneria, a rare actinobacteria belonging to the family Pseudonocardiaceae has abundance of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and is one of important source of natural products and worthy of priority investigation. Currently, Kutzneria chonburiensis SMC256T has been the latest type-strain of the genus and its genome sequence has not been reported yet. Therefore, we present the first report of new complete genome sequence of SMC256T (genome size of 10.4 Mbp) with genome annotation and feature comparison between SMC256T and other publicly available Kutzneria species. The results from comparative and functional genomic analyses regarding the phylogenomic and the clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COGs) analyses indicated that SMC256T is most closely related to Kutzneria sp. 744, Kutzneria kofuensis, Kutzneria sp.

Out of which, 38 clusters showing the best hit to the most known BGCs were predicted in the SMC256Tgenome. We observed that six clusters responsible for biosynthesis of antimicrobials/antitumor metabolites were strain-specific in Kutzneria chonburiensis. These putative metabolites include virginiamycin S1, lysolipin I, esmeraldin, rakicidin, aclacinomycin and streptoseomycin. Based on these findings, the genome of Kutzneria chonburiensis contains distinct and unidentified BGCs different from other members of the genus, and the use of integrative genomic-based approach would be a useful alternative effort to target, isolate and identify putative and undiscovered secondary metabolites suspected to have new and/or specific bioactivity in the Kutzneria.",4.6,"Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Public Health, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand. manee.cha@mahidol.ac.th.; Omics Sciences and Bioinformatics Center, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand.; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand.",0

However, marker-assisted selection has proven its potential for improving qualitative traits with large effects regulated by one to few genes. Its contribution to the improvement of the quantitative traits regulated by a number of small-effect genes is modest. In this context, genomic selection (GS) has been regarded as the most promising method for genetically enhancing complicated features that are regulated by several genes, each of which has minor effects. By examining a population's phenotypes and high-density marker scores, genomic selection can forecast the breeding potential of individual lines. The fact that GS uses all marker data in the prediction model prevents skewed marker effect estimations and maximizes the amount of variation caused by small-effect QTL. It has the ability to speed up the breeding cycle and as a consequence of which superior genotypes are selected rapidly. Developing the best GS models while taking into account non-additive effects, genotype-by-environment interaction, and cost-effectiveness will enable the widespread implementation of GS in plants. These steps will also increase heritability estimation and prediction accuracy.

Due to multiple complex adaptive and neutral forces which impose evolutionary pressures on genomes, there is a huge variability of genomic features. However, their variability and the extent to which genomic content determines the distribution of recovered loci in reduced representation sequencing studies is largely unexplored. Here, by using 80 genome assemblies, we observed that whereas plants primarily increase their genome size by expanding their intergenic regions, animals expand both intergenic and intronic regions, although the expansion patterns differ between deuterostomes and protostomes. Loci mapping in introns, exons, and intergenic categories obtained by in silico digestion using 2b-enzymes are positively correlated with the percentage of these regions in the corresponding genomes, suggesting that loci distribution mostly mirrors genomic architecture of the selected taxon. However, exonic regions showed a significant enrichment of loci in all groups regardless of the used enzyme. Moreover, when using selective adaptors to obtain a secondarily reduced loci dataset, the percentage and distribution of retained loci also varied. Adaptors with G/C terminals recovered a lower percentage of selected loci, with a further enrichment of exonic regions, while adaptors with A/T terminals retained a higher percentage of loci and slightly selected more intronic regions than expected.

Genome research on dinoflagellates has lagged due to their immense genome sizes in most species (~ 1-250 Gbp). Nevertheless, the last decade marked a fruitful era of dinoflagellate genomics, with 27 genomes sequenced and many insights attained. This review aims to synthesize information from these genomes, along with other omic data, to reflect on where we are now in understanding dinoflagellates and where we are heading in the future. The most notable insights from the decade-long genomics work include: (1) dinoflagellate genomes have been expanded in multiple times independently, probably by a combination of rampant retroposition, accumulation of repetitive DNA, and genome duplication; (2) Symbiodiniacean genomes are highly divergent, but share about 3,445 core unigenes concentrated in 219 KEGG pathways; (3) Most dinoflagellate genes are encoded unidirectionally and are not intron-poor; (4) The dinoflagellate nucleus has undergone extreme evolutionary changes, including complete or nearly complete loss of nucleosome and histone H1, and acquisition of dinoflagellate viral nuclear protein (DVNP); (5) Major basic nuclear protein (MBNP), histone-like protein (HLP), and bacterial HU-like protein (HCc) belong to the same protein family, and MBNP can be the unifying name; (6) Dinoflagellate gene expression is regulated by poorly understood mechanisms, but microRNA and other epigenetic mechanisms are likely important; (7) Over 50% of dinoflagellate genes are ""dark"" and their functions remain to be deciphered using functional genetics; (8) Initial insights into the genomic basis of parasitism and mutualism have emerged.

However, few molecular markers have been effectively utilized for resource development and molecular genetic breeding of these species. Sequencing of their genomes allowed us to develop genomic markers (e.g. simple sequence repeats (SSRs)) and construct a high-density physical map. A total of 369,557, 332,627, and 276,245 SSRs were identified in 13 high-quality assembled pseudochromosomes and their unassembled scaffolds for B. papyrifera, B. monoica, and B. kaempferi, respectively. Among the identified genomic SSRs across the three species, short repeat sequences were more abundant, while long repeat sequences constituted a smaller proportion. Additionally, the predominant repeat motifs in the SSRs of the three Broussonetia species were composed of 'A' and 'T' repeats. Using B. papyrifera genome as a reference, 4,419 common SSRs were identified among these three species, while 2,048 SSRs were specific to B. kaempferi, and 4,285 SSRs were specific to B. monoica. Distribution analysis indicated a notable similarity in the distribution patterns of SSRs across the pseudochromosomes of these three species. Furthermore, of the identified SSRs, 28%, 31%, and 24% were mapped to genes in B. papyrifera, B. kaempferi, and B. monoica, respectively. Genic-mapped SSRs may regulate biological processes by influencing gene activity and protein function. To verify SSRs polymorphism, we selected 30 ones from 10,752 potentially polymorphic SSRs loci for PCR amplification among these three species, all of which were successfully amplified and exhibited polymorphism across these three species.

Large genome size may be associated with lower selection efficiency because lower effective population sizes allow fixation of deleterious mutations via genetic drift, increasing genome size and decreasing selection efficiency. Because of a hypothesized negative relationship between genome size and recombination rate per base pair, increased genome size could also increase the effect of linked selection in the genome, decreasing the efficiency with which natural selection can fix or remove mutations. We used a transcriptomic dataset of 15 and a subset of six Neotropical salamander species ranging in genome size from 12 to 87 pg to study the relationship between genome size and efficiency of selection. We estimated dN/dS of salamanders with small and large genomes and tested for relaxation of selection in the larger genomes. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find a significant relationship between genome size and selection efficiency or strong evidence for higher dN/dS values in species with larger genomes for either species set. We also found little evidence for relaxation of selection in species with larger genomes. A positive correlation between genome size and range size (a proxy of population size) in this group disagrees with predictions of stronger drift in species with larger genomes.

Despite the importance of lncRNAs, only a few model fungi have well-documented inventories of lncRNA. In this study, we apply a recent computational pipeline to predict high-confidence lncRNA candidates in Zymoseptoria tritici, an important global pathogen of wheat impacting global food production. We analyse genomic features of lncRNAs and the most likely associated processes through analyses of expression over a host infection cycle. We find that lncRNAs are frequently expressed during early infection, before the switch to necrotrophic growth. They are mostly located in facultative heterochromatic regions, which are known to contain many genes associated with pathogenicity. Furthermore, we find that lncRNAs are frequently co-expressed with genes that may be involved in responding to host defence signals, such as oxidative stress. Finally, we assess pangenome features of lncRNAs using four additional reference-quality genomes. We find evidence that the repertoire of expressed lncRNAs varies substantially between individuals, even though lncRNA loci tend to be shared at the genomic level.

Using synthetic nematicides to control plant-parasitic nematodes has resulted in broad-spectrum toxicity to the environment. Plant-derived secondary metabolites have recently emerged as viable options that provide effective, greener, and renewable routes for managing plant-parasitic nematodes in various cropping systems. However, limited comprehensive information on plant-derived secondary metabolites sources, chemical structures, and nematicidal activities is available. This study aims to compile and analyze data on plant-based secondary metabolites with nematicidal properties collected over the last two decades. In this review, we identified 262 plant-based metabolites with nematicidal activities that were isolated from 35 plant families and 65 plant species. Alkaloids, terpenoids, saponins, flavonoids, coumarins, thiophenes, and annonaceous acetogenins were among the most studied compounds. In addition to the structure-activity relation for specific metabolites with nematicidal potency, various techniques for their extraction and isolation from plant material are discussed. Our findings demonstrate the potential of plants as a feedstock for sourcing nematicidal compounds and discovering new chemistries that could potentially be used for developing the next generation of nematicides. © 2024 The Author(s).

Six complete genomes were de novo hybrid assembled using a combination of short and long-read technologies. These Paracoccus genomes increase the number of completely closed high-quality genomes of type strains from 15 to 21. Pan-genome analysis revealed an open pan-genome composed of 13,819 genes with a minimal chromosomal core (8.84%) highlighting the genomic adaptation potential and the huge impact of extra-chromosomal elements. All genomes are shaped by the acquisition of various mobile genetic elements including genomic islands, prophages, transposases, and insertion sequences emphasizing their genomic plasticity. In terms of lifestyle, each mobile genetic elements should be evaluated separately with respect to the ecological context. Free-living genomes, in contrast to host-associated, tend to comprise (1) larger genomes, or the highest number of extra-chromosomal elements, (2) higher number of genomic islands and insertion sequence elements, and (3) a lower number of intact prophage regions. Regarding lifestyle adaptations, free-living genomes share genes linked to genetic exchange via T4SS, especially relevant for Paracoccus, known for their numerous extrachromosomal elements, enabling adaptation to dynamic environments. Conversely, host-associated genomes feature diverse genes involved in molecule transport, cell wall modification, attachment, stress protection, DNA repair, carbon, and nitrogen metabolism. Due to the vast number of adaptive genes, Paracoccus can quickly adapt to changing environmental conditions.",3.7,"Genomic and Applied Microbiology and Göttingen Genomics Laboratory, Institute of Microbiology and Genetics, Georg-August University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany.; Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany.",0

The major abiotic factors such as drought, heat, cold, salinity, etc., hamper a plant's innate growth and development, resulting in reduced yield and quality, with the possibility of undesired traits. In the 21st century, the advent of high-throughput sequencing tools, state-of-the-art biotechnological techniques and bioinformatic analyzing pipelines led to the easy characterization of plant traits for abiotic stress response and tolerance mechanisms by applying the 'omics' toolbox. Panomics pipeline including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, proteogenomics, interactomics, ionomics, phenomics, etc., have become very handy nowadays. This is important to produce climate-smart future crops with a proper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of abiotic stress responses by the plant's genes, transcripts, proteins, epigenome, cellular metabolic circuits and resultant phenotype. Instead of mono-omics, two or more (hence 'multi-omics') integrated-omics approaches can decipher the plant's abiotic stress tolerance response very well. Multi-omics-characterized plants can be used as potent genetic resources to incorporate into the future breeding program. For the practical utility of crop improvement, multi-omics approaches for particular abiotic stress tolerance can be combined with genome-assisted breeding (GAB) by being pyramided with improved crop yield, food quality and associated agronomic traits and can open a new era of omics-assisted breeding. Thus, multi-omics pipelines together are able to decipher molecular processes, biomarkers, targets for genetic engineering, regulatory networks and precision agriculture solutions for a crop's variable abiotic stress tolerance to ensure food security under changing environmental circumstances.",3.5,"Department of Plant Pathology and Weed Research, Institute of Plant Protection, Agricultural Research Organization (ARO)-The Volcani Institute, Rishon Lezion 7505101, Israel.; School of Bioscience, Seacom Skills University, Bolpur 731236, West Bengal, India.; Dr. Vikram Sarabhai Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Vadodara 390002, Gujarat, India.; Department of Biotechnology and Bioscience, Banasthali Vidyapith, Banasthali 304022, Rajasthan, India.; Department of Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Sri Krishnadevaraya College of Agricultural Sciences (SKCAS), Affiliated to Acharya N.G.

However, the absence of standardized naming conventions for genome assemblies and annotations across datasets creates substantial challenges. Inconsistent naming hinders the identification of correct assemblies, complicates the integration of bioinformatics pipelines, and makes it difficult to link assemblies across multiple resources. To address this, we developed a specification for standardizing the naming of reference genome assemblies, to improve consistency across datasets and facilitate interoperability. This specification was created with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) practices in mind, ensuring that reference assemblies are easier to locate, access, and reuse across research communities. Additionally, it has been designed to comply with primary genomic data repositories, including members of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration consortium, ensuring compatibility with widely used databases. While initially tailored to the agricultural genomics community, the specification is adaptable for use across different taxa. Widespread adoption of this standardized nomenclature would streamline assembly management, better enable cross-species analyses, and improve the reproducibility of research. It would also enhance natural language processing applications that depend on consistent reference assembly names in genomic literature, promoting greater integration and automated analysis of genomic data.

Schonl. is a very small annual plant growing along riverbanks. Chloroplast (cp) genomes, crucial for photosynthesis, are highly conserved and play a key role in understanding plant evolution. In this study, we conducted cp genome analysis of C. aquatica, aiming to elucidate its phylogenetic position and structural variations. We analyzed and described the features of the complete cp genome of C. aquatica and conducted comparative analysis with the cp genomes of closely related taxa. The cp genome was 144,503 bp in length and exhibited the typical quadripartite structure, consisting of a large single-copy region (LSC; 77,993 bp), a small single-copy region (SSC; 16,784 bp), and two inverted repeats (24,863 bp). The cp genome of C. aquatica comprised 113 unique genes, including 79 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 30 tRNAs, and 4 rRNA genes. Comparative genomic analysis of 13 other Crassula species and six outgroups demonstrated highly conserved gene content and order among Crassula species. However, notable differences were observed, including the complete loss of the rpoC1 intron in C. aquatica and several closely related species, which may serve as a synapomorphic trait supporting the monophyly of the subgenus Disporocarpa. We analyzed the nucleotide diversity among 14 Crassula cp genomes and identified five highly variable regions (pi > 0.08) in the IGS regions. Phylogenetic analysis based on 78 PCGs confirmed the monophyly of Crassula and its division into two subgenera: Crassula and Disporocarpa. Although the phylogenetic tree supported the subgeneric classification system, the sectional classification system requires reassessment. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the cp genome of the genus Crassula. We inferred evolutionary trends within the Crassula cp genome and provided molecular evidence supporting the integration of the genus Tillaea into the genus Crassula.

Multiple different methods are currently used to cluster together closely related genomes, potentially leading to inconsistency between studies. Here, we use a global dataset of 26 306 Streptococcus pneumoniae genomes to compare four clustering methods: gene-by-gene seven-locus MLST, core genome MLST (cgMLST)-based hierarchical clustering (HierCC) assignments, life identification number (LIN) barcoding and k-mer-based PopPUNK clustering (known as GPSCs in this species). We compare the clustering results with phylogenetic and pan-genome analyses to assess their relationship with genome diversity and evolution, as we would expect a good clustering method to form a single monophyletic cluster that has high within-cluster similarity of genomic content. We show that the four methods are generally able to accurately reflect the population structure based on these metrics and that the methods were broadly consistent with each other. We investigated further to study the discrepancies in clusters. The greatest concordance was seen between LIN barcoding and HierCC (adjusted mutual information score=0.950), which was expected given that both methods utilize cgMLST, but have different methods for defining an individual cluster and different core genome schema. However, the existence of differences between the two methods shows that the selection of a core genome schema can introduce inconsistencies between studies. GPSC and HierCC assignments were also highly concordant (AMI=0.946), showing that k-mer-based methods which use the whole genome and do not require the careful selection of a core genome schema are just as effective at representing the population structure. Additionally, where there were differences in clustering between these methods, this could be explained by differences in the accessory genome that were not identified in cgMLST. We conclude that for S. pneumoniae, standardized and stable nomenclature is important as the number of genomes available expands. Furthermore, the research community should transition away from seven-locus MLST, whilst cgMLST, GPSC and LIN assignments should be used more widely. However, to allow for easy comparison between studies and to make previous literature relevant, the reporting of multiple clustering names should be standardized within the research.",3.9,"Parasites and Microbes, The Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.; Rollins School Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Emory Global Health Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, London, UK.; EMBL-EBI, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.; Milner Centre for Evolution, Department of Life Sciences, University of Bath, Bath, UK.",0

Of the 23 chromosome-scale reference genomes across the order, only 12 of the ~60 squamate families are represented. Within geckos (infraorder Gekkota), a species-rich clade of lizards, chromosome-level genomes are exceptionally sparse representing only two of the seven extant families. Using the latest advances in genome sequencing and assembly methods, we generated one of the highest-quality squamate genomes to date for the leopard gecko, Eublepharis macularius (Eublepharidae). We compared this assembly to the previous, short-read only, E. macularius reference genome published in 2016 and examined potential factors within the assembly influencing contiguity of genome assemblies using PacBio HiFi data. Briefly, the read N50 of the PacBio HiFi reads generated for this study was equal to the contig N50 of the previous E. macularius reference genome at 20.4 kilobases. The HiFi reads were assembled into a total of 132 contigs, which was further scaffolded using HiC data into 75 total sequences representing all 19 chromosomes. We identified 9 of the 19 chromosomal scaffolds were assembled as a near-single contig, whereas the other 10 chromosomes were each scaffolded together from multiple contigs.

The number of genome rearrangements that happened between two genomes is often used as the evolutionary distance between these species. This number is often estimated as the minimum number of genome rearrangements required to transform one genome into another which are only reliable for closely-related genomes. These estimations often underestimate the evolutionary distance for genomes that have substantially evolved from each other, and advanced statistical methods can be used to improve accuracy. Several statistical estimators have been developed, under various evolutionary models, of which the most complete one, INFER, takes into account different degrees of genome fragility. We present TruEst-an efficient tool that estimates the evolutionary distance between the genomes under the INFER model of genome rearrangements. We apply our method to both simulated and real data.

As an important genetic resource, C. mollissima is vital in enhancing edible chestnut varieties and offers significant insights into the origin and evolution of chestnut species. While the chloroplast genome of C. mollissima has been sequenced, its mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) remains largely uncharted. In this study, we have characterized the C. mollissima mitogenome, assembling it utilizing reads from both BGI and Nanopore sequencing platforms, and conducted a comparative analysis with the mitochondrial genomes of closely related species. The mitogenome of C. mollissima manifests a polycyclic structure consisting of two circular molecules measuring 363,232 bp and 24,806 bp, respectively. This genome encompasses 35 unique protein-coding genes, 19 tRNA genes, and three rRNA genes. A total of 139 SSRs were identified throughout the entire C. mollissima mitogenome. Furthermore, the combined length of homologous fragments between the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes was 5766 bp, constituting 1.49% of the mitogenome. We also predicted 484 RNA editing sites in C. mollissima, demonstrating C-to-U RNA editing. Phylogenetic analysis of related species' mitogenomes showed that C. mollissima was closely related to Lithocarpus litseifolius (Hance) Chun and Quercus acutissima Carruth.

Here, we analyze 23 woolly mammoth genomes, including one of the oldest known specimens at 700,000 years old, to identify fixed derived non-synonymous mutations unique to the species and to obtain estimates of when these mutations evolved. We find that at the time of its origin, the woolly mammoth had already acquired a broad spectrum of positively selected genes, including ones associated with hair and skin development, fat storage and metabolism, and immune system function. Our results also suggest that these phenotypes continued to evolve during the last 700,000 years, but through positive selection on different sets of genes.

Thanks to the introduction of the concept of pangenome, it is possible to use exceedingly detailed sequence data to study the evolutionary history of two different species, or how populations within a species differ genetically. In the wake of the Human Pangenome Project, this review aims at discussing the advantages of the pangenome around human genetic variation, which are then framed around how pangenomic data can inform population genetics, phylogenetics, and public health policy by providing insights into the genetic basis of diseases or determining personalized treatments, targeting the specific genetic profile of an individual.

**引言**：脆弱拟杆菌（*Bacteroides fragilis*）是一种革兰氏阴性厌氧菌，属于人体胃肠道微生物群的一部分，并常作为肠外条件致病菌被发现。脆弱拟杆菌分为两个不同的组别——I组和II组，其特征在于分别存在或不存在与β-内酰胺类抗生素耐药性相关的基因（*cepA* 和 *ccrA*（*cfiA*））。目前尚未对公共数据库中脆弱拟杆菌的序列数据进行大规模分析，该物种的抗性组仍定义不清。  
**假设/研究空白**：有提议将I组和II组脆弱拟杆菌重新分类为两个独立的物种，但需要更多证据支持。  
**目的**：本研究旨在调查GenBank中脆弱拟杆菌基因组的基因组多样性，并评估公共数据库中I组和II组菌株的流行率，同时生成进一步证据以证明I组和II组脆弱拟杆菌代表不同的基因组种。  
**方法**：纳入了GenBank中标记为脆弱拟杆菌的高质量基因组（n=377），并进行了泛基因组和功能分析。此外，利用《综合抗生素抗性数据库》对基因组数据进行了抗性组谱分析。  
**结果**：平均核苷酸一致性（ANI）和系统发育分析表明，脆弱拟杆菌I组和II组代表两个不同的物种：严格意义上的脆弱拟杆菌（*B. fragilis* sensu stricto，n=275个基因组）和脆弱拟杆菌A（*B. fragilis* A，n=102个基因组；基因组分类数据库中的命名）。对严格意义上的脆弱拟杆菌和脆弱拟杆菌A的泛基因组探索显示，这两个物种在核心基因和辅助基因水平上均存在分离。  
**结论**：研究结果表明，先前被称为II组脆弱拟杆菌的脆弱拟杆菌A是一个独立的物种，且与严格意义上的脆弱拟杆菌不同。脆弱拟杆菌的泛基因组分析支持了之前的基因组、系统发育和抗性组筛查分析，共同证实了I组和II组是两个独立的物种。此外，还确认了I组和II组脆弱拟杆菌的辅助基因差异主要与碳水化合物代谢相关，并表明除了抗菌素耐药性之外，其他差异也可能用于区分这两个物种。",English Jamie; Newberry Fiona; Hoyles Lesley; Patrick Sheila; Stewart Linda,Genomic analyses of Bacteroides fragilis: subdivisions I and II represent distinct species.,pangenome,Q3,taxonomy; Bacteroidaceae; antimicrobial resistance,I型和II型代表不同物种,"Introduction. Bacteroides fragilis is a Gram-negative anaerobe that is a member of the human gastrointestinal microbiota and is frequently found as an extra-intestinal opportunistic pathogen. B. fragilis comprises two distinct groups - divisions I and II - characterized by the presence/absence of genes [cepA and ccrA (cfiA), respectively] that confer resistance to β-lactam antibiotics by either serine or metallo-β-lactamase production. No large-scale analyses of publicly available B. fragilis sequence data have been undertaken, and the resistome of the species remains poorly defined.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Reclassification of divisions I and II B. fragilis as two distinct species has been proposed but additional evidence is required.Aims. To investigate the genomic diversity of GenBank B. fragilis genomes and establish the prevalence of division I and II strains among publicly available B. fragilis genomes, and to generate further evidence to demonstrate that B. fragilis division I and II strains represent distinct genomospecies.Methodology. High-quality (n=377) genomes listed as B. fragilis in GenBank were included in pangenome and functional analyses. Genome data were also subject to resistome profiling using The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database.Results. Average nucleotide identity and phylogenetic analyses showed B. fragilis divisions I and II represent distinct species: B. fragilis sensu stricto (n=275 genomes) and B. fragilis A (n=102 genomes; Genome Taxonomy Database designation), respectively. Exploration of the pangenome of B. fragilis sensu stricto and B. fragilis A revealed separation of the two species at the core and accessory gene levels.Conclusion. The findings indicate that B. fragilis A, previously referred to as division II B. fragilis, is an individual species and distinct from B. fragilis sensu stricto. The B. fragilis pangenome analysis supported previous genomic, phylogenetic and resistome screening analyses collectively reinforcing that divisions I and II are two separate species. In addition, it was confirmed that differences in the accessory genes of B. fragilis divisions I and II are primarily associated with carbohydrate metabolism and suggest that differences other than antimicrobial resistance could also be used to distinguish between these two species.",2.0,"Institute for Global Food Security, School of Biological Sciences, Queen's University, Belfast, UK.; Department of Biosciences, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK.; Wellcome Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast, BT9 7BL, UK.",0

Ferragina and Fischer [1] observed in 2007 that word-based indexes often use fewer random accesses than character-based indexes, and thus support faster searches. Since DNA lacks natural word-boundaries, however, it is necessary to parse it somehow before applying word-based FM-indexing. In 2022, Deng et al. [2] proposed parsing genomic data by induced suffix sorting, and showed that the resulting word-based FM-indexes support faster counting queries than standard FM-indexes when patterns are a few thousand characters or longer. In this paper we show that using prefix-free parsing-which takes parameters that let us tune the average length of the phrases-instead of induced suffix sorting, gives a significant speedup for patterns of only a few hundred characters. We implement our method and demonstrate it is between 3 and 18 times faster than competing methods on queries to GRCh38, and is consistently faster on queries made to 25,000, 50,000 and 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

We comprehensively discuss the advancements in pangenome-based genomic integrative genomic discoveries across forensic-related species (humans, animals, and plants) and summarize their applications in variant identification and forensic genomics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, and microbiome research. Recent developments in multiplexed array sequencing have introduced a highly efficient and programmable technique to overcome the limitations of short forensic marker lengths in LRS platforms. This technique enables the concatenation of short RNA transcripts and DNA fragments into LRS-optimal molecules for sequencing, assembly, and genotyping. The integration of new pangenome reference coordinates and corresponding computational algorithms will benefit forensic integrative genomics by facilitating new marker identification, accurate genotyping, high-resolution panel development, and the updating of statistical algorithms.

Ferragina and Fischer [1] observed in 2007 that word-based indexes often use fewer random accesses than character-based indexes, and thus support faster searches. Since DNA lacks natural word-boundaries, however, it is necessary to parse it somehow before applying word-based FM-indexing. Last year, Deng et al. [2] proposed parsing genomic data by induced suffix sorting, and showed the resulting word-based FM-indexes support faster counting queries than standard FM-indexes when patterns are a few thousand characters or longer. In this paper we show that using prefix-free parsing-which takes parameters that let us tune the average length of the phrases-instead of induced suffix sorting, gives a significant speedup for patterns of only a few hundred characters.

However, efficiently aligning sequences to these graphs with complex topology and cycles can be challenging. The seed-chain-extend based alignment algorithms use co-linear chaining as a standard technique to identify a good cluster of exact seed matches that can be combined to form an alignment. Recent works show how the co-linear chaining problem can be efficiently solved for acyclic pangenome graphs by exploiting their small width and how incorporating gap cost in the scoring function improves alignment accuracy. However, it remains open on how to effectively generalize these techniques for general pangenome graphs which contain cycles. Here we present the first practical formulation and an exact algorithm for co-linear chaining on cyclic pangenome graphs. We rigorously prove the correctness and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. We evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm by aligning simulated long reads from the human genome to a cyclic pangenome graph constructed from 95 publicly available haplotype-resolved human genome assemblies.

For this purpose, whole genomes of the six strains were sequenced by different technologies including Illumina and PacBio, and the resulting sequences were corrected. Genomes were annotated and compared using different online tools. Furthermore, the study of core- and pan-genomes were examined, and the phylogeny was inferred.

However, the patterns and mechanisms of prokaryote diversification have received relatively little attention compared to animals and plants. Adaptive radiation, the rapid diversification of an ancestor species into multiple ecologically divergent species, is a fundamental process by which macrobiological diversity is generated. Here, we discuss whether ecological opportunity could lead to similar bursts of diversification in bacteria. We explore how adaptive radiations in prokaryotes can be kickstarted by horizontally acquired key innovations allowing lineages to invade new niche space that subsequently is partitioned among diversifying specialist descendants. We discuss how novel adaptive zones are colonized and exploited after the evolution of a key innovation and whether certain types of are more prone to adaptive radiation. Radiation into niche specialists does not necessarily lead to speciation in bacteria when barriers to recombination are absent.

Simple text formats, like VCF or BED, have been widely adopted and helped the critical exchange of genomic information. There is a dire need for tools and formats enabling pangenomic annotation to facilitate such enrichment of pangenomic references. The Graph Alignment Format (GAF) is a text format, tab-delimited like BED/VCF files, which was proposed to represent alignments. GAF could also be used to store paths representing annotations in a pangenome graph, but there are no tools to index and query them efficiently. Here, we present extensions to vg and HTSlib that provide efficient sorting, indexing, and querying for GAF files. With this approach, annotations overlapping a subgraph can be extracted quickly. Paths are sorted based on the IDs of traversed nodes, compressed with BGZIP, and indexed with HTSlib/tabix via our extensions for the GAF format. Compared to the binary GAM format, GAF files are easier to edit or inspect because they are plain text, and we show that they are twice as fast to sort and half as large on disk. In addition, we updated vg annotate, which takes BED or GFF3 annotation files relative to linear sequences and projects them into the pangenome. It can now produce GAF files representing these annotations' paths through the pangenome. We showcase these new tools on several applications. We projected annotations for all Human Pangenome Reference Consortium Year 1 haplotypes, including genes, segmental duplications, tandem repeats and repeats annotations, into the Minigraph-Cactus pangenome (GRCh38-based v1.1). We also projected known variants from the GWAS Catalog and expression QTLs from the GTEx project into the pangenome.

TB infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis can occur in the lungs, causing pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), or in any other organ of the body, resulting in extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB). There is no consensus on the genetic determinants of this pathogen that may contribute to EPTB. In this study, we constructed the M. tuberculosis pangenome and used it as a tool to seek genomic signatures associated with the clinical presentation of TB based on its accessory genome differences. The analysis carried out in the present study includes the raw reads of 490 M. tuberculosis genomes (PTB n = 245, EPTB n = 245) retrieved from public databases that were assembled, as well as ten genomes from Mexican strains (PTB n = 5, EPTB n = 5) that were sequenced and assembled. All genomes were annotated and then used to construct the pangenome with Roary and Panaroo. The pangenome obtained using Roary consisted of 2231 core genes and 3729 accessory genes. On the other hand, the pangenome resulting from Panaroo consisted of 2130 core genes and 5598 accessory genes. Associations between the distribution of accessory genes and the PTB/EPTB phenotypes were examined using the Scoary and Pyseer tools. Both tools found a significant association between the hspR, plcD, Rv2550c, pe_pgrs5, pe_pgrs25, and pe_pgrs57 genes and the PTB genotype. In contrast, the deletion of the aceA, esxR, plcA, and ppe50 genes was significantly associated with the EPTB phenotype. Rv1759c and Rv3740 were found to be associated with the PTB phenotype according to Scoary; however, these associations were not observed when using Pyseer. The robustness of the constructed pangenome and the gene-phenotype associations is supported by several factors, including the analysis of a large number of genomes, the inclusion of the same number of PTB/EPTB genomes, and the reproducibility of results thanks to the different bioinformatic tools used. Such characteristics surpass most of previous M. tuberculosis pangenomes.

Since the late 1970s, the lake has undergone increasing eutrophication pressure, due to wastewater input, leading to the occurrence of frequent cyanobacterial blooms. The major difference observed between PAMP2011 and PAMP2012 MAGs was the lack of the saxitoxin gene cluster in PAMP2012, which also presented a smaller genome, while PAMP2011 presented the complete sxt cluster and all essential proteins and clusters. The pangenome analysis was performed with all Raphidiopsis/Cylindrospermopsis genomes available at NCBI to date, with the addition of PAMP2011 and PAMP2012 MAGs (All33 subset), but also without the South American strains (noSA subset), and only among the South American strains (SA10 and SA8 subsets). We observed a substantial increase in the core genome size for the 'noSA' subset, in comparison to 'All33' subset, and since the core genome reflects the closeness among the pangenome members, the results strongly suggest that the conservation level of the essential gene repertoire seems to be affected by the geographic origin of the strains being analyzed, supporting the existence of a distinct SA clade.

方法：我们对1999年至2020年间从葡萄牙肺炎链球菌感染患者中分离出的501株血清型3菌株进行了全基因组测序（WGS）。这些草图基因组经过系统发育分析、泛基因组分析以及全基因组关联研究（GWAS）。此外，我们还完成了抗生素敏感性测试，并整合了超过2600个血清型3多 locus 序列类型180（MLST180）的WGS数据以进行全球比较基因组学分析。  
结果：在非侵入性肺炎分离株与侵袭性疾病分离株之间（Fisher精确检验，P=0.29），以及成人病例与儿童病例之间（Fisher精确检验，P=0.074），CC180 Clades I、II、III、IV和VI的分布相似。PCV13接种后，血清型3的CC发生了变化（Fisher精确检验，P<0.0001），Clade I成为主导。Clade I主要对抗生素敏感，并携带phiOXC141前噬菌体，但其泛基因组异质性较高。葡萄牙和西班牙的菌株在PCV13接种后Clade I仍占主导地位，其泛基因组较大，并与两个编码假想蛋白的基因的存在相关。  
解释：尽管受到前噬菌体负担和抗生素敏感性的限制，PCV13接种后Clade I在葡萄牙仍成为主导。辅助基因组内容可能缓解了这些适应性成本。Clade I流行率和泛基因组异质性的区域差异表明，克隆动态并非理解血清型3疫苗逃逸现象的一般化方法。

The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) does not have significant efficacy against serotype 3 despite polysaccharide inclusion in the vaccine. It was hypothesized that PCV13 may effectively control Clade I of CC180 but that Clades III and IV are resistant, provoking a population shift that enables serotype 3 persistence. This has been observed in the United States, England, and Wales but not Spain. We tested this hypothesis further utilizing a dataset from Portugal. Methods We whole-genome sequenced (WGS) 501 serotype 3 strains from Portugal isolated from patients with pneumococcal infections between 1999-2020. The draft genomes underwent phylogenetic analyses, pangenome profiling, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We also completed antibiotic susceptibility testing and compiled over 2,600 serotype 3 multilocus sequence type 180 (MLST180) WGSs to perform global comparative genomics. Findings CC180 Clades I, II, III, IV, and VI distributions were similar when comparing non-invasive pneumonia isolates and invasive disease isolates (Fisher's exact test, P=0.29), and adult and pediatric cases (Fisher's exact test, P=0.074). The serotype 3 CCs shifted post-PCV13 (Fisher's exact test, P<0.0001) and Clade I became dominant. Clade I is largely antibiotic-sensitive and carries the phiOXC141 prophage but the pangenome is heterogenous. Strains from Portugal and Spain, where Clade I remains dominant post-PCV13, have larger pangenomes and are associated with the presence of two genes encoding hypothetical proteins. Interpretation Clade I became dominant in Portugal post-PCV13, despite the burden of the prophage and antibiotic sensitivity. The accessory genome content may mitigate these fitness costs. Regional differences in Clade I prevalence and pangenome heterogeneity suggest that clade dynamics is not a generalizable approach to understanding serotype 3 vaccine escape.

Recent works highlight the advantage of haplotype-resolved pangenome graphs in addressing these challenges. Building on these developments, we propose a rigorous alignment-free genotyping framework. Our formulation seeks a path through the pangenome graph that maximizes the matches between the path and substrings of sequencing reads (e.g., k-mers) while minimizing recombination events (haplotype switches) along the path.

To help identify such candidate genes, several recent tools estimate microbial gene copy numbers directly from metagenomes. These tools rely on alignments to pangenomes, which in turn are derived from the set of all individual genomes from one species. While large-scale metagenomic assembly efforts have made pangenome estimates more complete, mixed communities can also introduce contamination into assemblies, and it is unknown how robust pangenome-based metagenomic analyses are to these errors. To gain insight into this problem, we re-analyzed a case-control study of the gut microbiome in cirrhosis, focusing on commensal Clostridia previously implicated in this disease. We tested for differentially prevalent genes in the Lachnospiraceae, then investigated which were likely to be contaminants using sequence similarity searches. Out of 86 differentially prevalent genes, we found that 33 (38%) were probably contaminants originating in taxa such as Veillonella and Haemophilus, unrelated genera that were independently correlated with disease status. Our results demonstrate that even small amounts of contamination in metagenome assemblies, below typical quality thresholds, can threaten to overwhelm gene-level metagenomic analyses. However, we also show that such contaminants can be accurately identified using a method based on gene-to-species correlation. After removing these contaminants, we observe that several flagellar motility gene clusters in the Lachnospira eligens pangenome are associated with cirrhosis status. We have integrated our analyses into an analysis and visualization pipeline, PanSweep, that can automatically identify cases where pangenome contamination may bias the results of gene-resolved analyses. Metagenome-assembled genomes, or MAGs, can be constructed without pure cultures of microbes. Large scale efforts to build MAGs have yielded more complete pangenomes (i.e., sets of all genes found in one species). Pangenomes allow us to measure strain variation in gene content, which can strongly affect phenotype. However, because MAGs come from mixed communities, they can contaminate pangenomes with unrelated DNA, and how much this impacts downstream analyses has not been studied. Using a metagenomic study of gut microbes in cirrhosis as our test case, we investigate how contamination affects analyses of microbial gene content. Surprisingly, even small, typical amounts of MAG contamination (<5%) result in disproportionately high levels of false positive associations (38%). Fortunately, we show that most contaminants can be automatically flagged, and provide a simple method for doing so.

The genome sequences from these strains were obtained and carefully controlled for quality. Deduced traditional phylotyping assigned almost all superficial isolates to type IA1, while the clinical strains were evenly distributed between types IA1, IB, and II. Single locus sequence typing (SLST) showed a predominance of A1 type for the control strains, whereas 56% of the clinical isolates belonged to types A1, H1 and K8.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from both the pangenome and SNP data consistently showed genomic differences between both groups located in metabolic pathway and DNA repair genes.

Many species in the genus have been isolated and characterized. However, few studies have focused on marine isolates or fish pathogens, and in-depth genomic analyses, particularly comparative analyses of isolates from different habitat types, are lacking. Here, we isolated 20 strains of the genus from various environments in South Korea and sequenced their full-length genomes. Combined with published sequence data, we examined genomic traits, evolution, environmental adaptation, and putative metabolic functions in total 187 genomes of isolated species in Flavobacterium categorized as marine, host-associated, and terrestrial including freshwater. A pangenome analysis revealed a correlation between genome size and coding or noncoding density. Flavobacterium spp. had high levels of diversity, allowing for novel gene repertories via recombination events. Defense-related genes only accounted for approximately 3% of predicted genes in all Flavobacterium genomes. While genes involved in metabolic pathways did not differ with respect to isolation source, there was substantial variation in genomic traits; in particular, the abundances of tRNAs and rRNAs were higher in the host-associdated group than in other groups. One genome in the host-associated group contained a Microviridae prophage closely related to an enterobacteria phage. The proteorhodopsin gene was only identified in four terrestrial strains isolated for this study. Furthermore, recombination events clearly influenced genomic diversity and may contribute to the response to environmental stress. These findings shed light on the high genetic variation in Flavobacterium and functional roles in diverse ecosystems as a result of their metabolic versatility. IMPORTANCE The genus Flavobacterium is a diverse group of bacteria that are found in a variety of environments. While most species of this genus are harmless and utilize organic substrates such as proteins and polysaccharides, some members may play a significant role in the cycling for organic substances within their environments. Nevertheless, little is known about the genomic dynamics and/or metabolic capacity of Flavobacterium. Here, we found that Flavobacterium species may have an open pangenome, containing a variety of diverse and novel gene repertoires. Intriguingly, we discovered that one genome (classified into host-associated group) contained a Microviridae prophage closely related to that of enterobacteria. Proteorhodopsin may be expressed under conditions of light or oxygen pressure in some strains isolated for this study.

Infections by the Borreliaceae are difficult to detect by both direct and indirect methods, often leading to delayed and missed diagnoses. Efforts to improve diagnoses center around the development of molecular diagnostics (MDx), but due to deep tissue sequestration of the causative spirochaetes and the lack of persistent bacteremias, even MDx assays suffer from a lack of sensitivity. Additionally, the highly extensive genomic heterogeneity among isolates, even within the same species, contributes to the lack of assay sensitivity as single target assays cannot provide universal coverage. This within-species heterogeneity is partly due to differences in replicon repertoires and genomic structures that have likely arisen to support the complex Borreliaceae lifecycle in which these parasites have to survive in multiple hosts each with unique immune responses.

It remains a major public health challenge in the endemic region around the Bay of Bengal. Over decadal time scales, one lineage typically dominates the others and spreads in global pandemic waves. However, it remains unclear to what extent diverse lineages co-circulate during a single outbreak season. Defining the pool of diversity during finer time scales is important because the selective pressures that impact V. cholerae - namely antibiotics and phages - are dynamic on these time scales. To study the nationwide diversity of V. cholerae, we long-read sequenced 273 V. cholerae genomes from seven hospitals over one year (2018) in Bangladesh. Four major V. cholerae lineages were identified: known lineages BD-1, BD-2a, and BD-2b, and a novel lineage that we call BD-3. In 2022, BD-1 caused a large cholera outbreak in Dhaka, apparently outcompeting BD-2 lineages. We show that, in 2018, BD-1 was already dominant in the five northern regions, including Dhaka, consistent with an origin from India in the north. By contrast, we observed a higher diversity of lineages in the two southern regions near the coast. The four lineages differed in pangenome content, including integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) and genes involved in resistance to bacteriophages and antibiotics. Notably, BD-2a lacked an ICE and is predicted to be more sensitive to phages and antibiotics, but nevertheless persisted throughout the year-long sampling period. Genes associated with antibiotic resistance in V. cholerae from Bangladesh in 2006 were entirely absent from all lineages in 2018-19, suggesting shifting costs and benefits of encoding these genes. Together, our results highlight the dynamic nature of the V. cholerae pangenome and the geographic structure of its lineage diversity.",未知,"Department of Microbiology & Immunology, McGill University, Montréal, Canada.; McGill Genome Centre, McGill University, Montréal, Canada.; Departments of Pediatrics and Environmental and Global Health, Emerging Pathogens Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.; Infectious Diseases Division (IDD), International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Alabama State University, Montgomery, AL, USA.; McGill Centre for Microbiome Research, McGill University, Montréal, Canada.",0

In this study, we conducted a metapangenomic analysis of oral Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species to uncover genomic diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and habitat specialization within the human oral cavity. Using three metrics-pangenomic gene content, phylogenomics, and average nucleotide identity (ANI)-we first identified distinct species and sub-species groups among these genera. Mapping of metagenomic reads then revealed clear patterns of habitat specialization, such as Aggregatibacter species predominantly in dental plaque, a distinctive Haemophilus parainfluenzae sub-species group on the tongue dorsum, and H. sp. HMT-036 predominantly in keratinized gingiva and buccal mucosa. In addition, we found that supragingival plaque samples contained predominantly only one out of the three taxa, H. parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, and A. sp. HMT-458, suggesting independent niches or a competitive relationship. Functional analyses revealed the presence of key metabolic genes, such as oxaloacetate decarboxylase, correlated with habitat specialization, suggesting metabolic versatility as a driving force. Additionally, heme synthesis distinguishes H. sp.

Overall, our study exemplifies the power of metapangenomics to identify factors that may affect ecological interactions within microbial communities, including genomic diversity, habitat specialization, and metabolic versatility. Understanding the microbial ecology of the mouth is essential for comprehending human physiology. This study employs metapangenomics to reveal that various Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species exhibit distinct ecological preferences within the oral cavity of healthy individuals, thereby supporting the site-specialist hypothesis.

Recently, a compressed-index data structure called the ""move structure"" was proposed as an alternative to other BWT-based indexes like the FM index and r-index. The move structure uniquely achieves both O(r) space and O(1)-time queries, where r is the number of runs in the pangenome BWT. We implemented Movi, an efficient tool for building and querying move-structure pangenome indexes. While the size of the Movi's index is larger than the r-index, it scales at a smaller rate for pangenome references, as its size is exactly proportional to r, the number of runs in the BWT of the reference. Movi can compute sophisticated matching queries needed for classification - such as pseudo-matching lengths and backward search - at least ten times faster than the fastest available methods, and in some cases more than 30-fold faster. Movi achieves this speed by leveraging the move structure's strong locality of reference, incurring close to the minimum possible number of cache misses for queries against large pangenomes. We achieve still further speed improvements by using memory prefetching to attain a degree of latency hiding that would be difficult with other index structures like the r-index.

While approximating vertical evolution through this approach has proven exceptionally valuable for understanding pathogen dynamics, it excludes a fundamental dimension of bacterial evolution-horizontal gene transfer. Incorporating the accessory genome is the logical remediation and has recently shown promise in expanding epidemiological resolution for enteric pathogens. Employing k-mer-based Jaccard index analysis, and a novel genome length distance metric, we computed pangenome (i.e., core and accessory) relatedness for the globally important pathogen Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (Typhi), and graphically express both vertical (homology-by-descent) and horizontal (homology-by-admixture) evolutionary relationships in a reticulate network of over 2,200 U.S. Typhi genomes. This analysis revealed non-random structure in the Typhi pangenome that is driven predominantly by the gain and loss of mobile genetic elements, confirming and expanding upon known epidemiological patterns, revealing novel plasmid dynamics, and identifying avenues for further genomic epidemiological exploration.

Plants have a variety of coping strategies to deal with salt stress, including osmosensing, osmoregulation, ion-homeostasis, increased antioxidant synthesis, and so on. Not only does salt stress cause oxidative stress but also many types of stress do as well, thus plants have an effective antioxidant system to battle the negative effects of excessive reactive oxygen species produced as a result of stress. Rising salinity in the agricultural field affects crop productivity and plant development considerably; nevertheless, plants have a well-known copying mechanism that shields them from salt stress by facilitated production of secondary metabolites, antioxidants, ionhomeostasis, ABAbiosynthesis, and so on.

We first review stomatal evolution and diversity, providing fossil and phylogenetic evidence of their origins. We summarize functional evolution of guard cell membrane transporters in the context of climate changes and environmental stresses. Our analyses show that the core signaling elements of stomatal movement are more ancient than stomata, while genes involved in stomatal development co-evolved de novo with the earliest stomata.

It enhances osmolyte production, increases antioxidant enzyme activity, and improves photosynthesis, thereby improving cellular functions. Understanding the melatonin-mediated response and signalling can sustain crop production in heavy metal-stressed soils. Melatonin is a pleiotropic signal molecule that plays a critical role in plant growth and stress tolerance, particularly against heavy metals in soil. Heavy metals (HMs) are ubiquitously found in the soil-water environment and readily taken up by plants, thereby disrupting mineral nutrient homeostasis, osmotic balance, oxidative stress, and altered primary and secondary metabolism. Plants combat HM stress through inbuilt defensive mechanisms, such as metal exclusion, restricted foliar translocation, metal sequestration and compartmentalization, chelation, and scavenging of free radicals by antioxidant enzymes. Melatonin has a protective effect against the damaging effects of HM stress in plants. It achieves this by immobilizing HM in cell walls and sequestering them in root cell vacuoles, reducing HM's translocation from roots to shoots. This mechanism improves the uptake of macronutrients and micronutrients in plants. Additionally, melatonin enhances osmolyte production, improving the plant's water relations, and increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes to limit lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Melatonin also decreases chlorophyll degradation while increasing its synthesis, and enhances RuBisCO activity for better photosynthesis. All these functions contribute to improving the cellular functions of plants exposed to HM stress.

This chemo-diversity is mainly underpinned by a highly complex and biodiverse biochemical machinery. Plant metabolic enzymes originated and were inherited from their eukaryotic and prokaryotic ancestors and further diversified by the unprecedentedly high rates of gene duplication and functionalization experienced in land plants. Unlike prokaryotic microbes, which display frequent horizontal gene transfer events and multiple inputs of energy and organic carbon, land plants predominantly rely on organic carbon generated from CO2 and have experienced relatively few gene transfers during their recent evolutionary history. As such, plant metabolic networks have evolved in a stepwise manner using existing networks as a starting point and under various evolutionary constraints.

Intercellular and intracellular microbial symbionts that are asymptomatic in their plant host during some or all of their life cycle - endophytes - can form mutualistic, commensal, or pathogenic relationships, and sometimes novel associations with alien plants. Fungal endophytes are likely the most common endosymbiont infecting plants, with life-history, morphological, physiological, and plant-symbiotic traits that are distinct from other endophytic guilds. Here, we review the community dynamics of fungal endophytes during the process of plant invasion, and how their functional role may shift during the different stages of invasion: transport, introduction (colonisation), establishment, and spread. Each invasion stage presents distinct ecological filters that an alien plant must overcome to advance to the subsequent stage of invasion. Endophytes can alternately aid the host in overcoming stage-specific filters, or contribute to the barriers imposed by filters (e.g. biotic resistance), thereby affecting invasion pathways. A few fungi can be transported as seed endophytes from their native range and be vertically transmitted to future generations in the non-native range, especially in graminoids. In other plant groups, alien plants mostly acquire endophytes via horizontal transmission from the invaded plant community, and the host endophyte community is shaped by host filtering and biogeographic factors (e.g. dispersal limitation, environmental filtering). Endophytes infecting alien plants (both those transported with their host and those accumulated in the non-native range) may influence invasion success by affecting plant growth, reproduction, environmental tolerance, and pathogen and herbivory defences; however, the direction and magnitude of these effects can be contingent upon the host identity, life stage, ecological conditions, and invasion stage. This context dependence may cause endophytic fungi to shift to a non-endophytic (e.g. pathogenic) functional life stage in the same or different hosts, which can modify alien-native plant community dynamics. We conclude by identifying paths in which alien hosts can exploit the context dependency of endophyte function in novel abiotic and biotic conditions and at the different stages of invasion.",,"Department of Botany, University of British Columbia, 3156-6270 University Blvd., Vancouver, British Columbia, V6T 1Z4, Canada.; Beaty Biodiversity Museum, University of British Columbia, 2212 Main Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6T 1Z4, Canada.; Department of Forest & Conservation Sciences, University of British Columbia, 3041-2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6T 1Z4, Canada.",0

Active restoration frequently involves revegetation, which leads to the dilemma of whether to conduct direct seeding or to plant nursery-grown seedlings. The choice of revegetation method can regulate plant survival and performance, with economic implications that ultimately feed back to our capacity to conduct restoration. We followed a peer-reviewed protocol to develop a systematic map that collates, describes and catalogues the available studies on how seeding compares to planting in achieving restoration targets. We compiled a database with the characteristics of all retrieved studies, which can be searched to identify studies of particular locations and habitats, objectives of restoration, plant material, technical aspects, and outcomes measured. The search was made in eight languages and retrieved 3355 publications, of which 178 were retained. The systematic map identifies research gaps, such as a lack of studies in the global South, in tropical rainforests, and covering a long time period, which represent opportunities to expand field-based research. Additionally, many studies overlooked reporting on important technical aspects such as seed provenance and nursery cultivation methods, and others such as watering or seedling protection were more frequently applied for planting than for seeding, which limits our capacity to learn from past research. Most studies measured outcomes related to the target plants but avoided measuring general restoration outcomes or economic aspects. This represents a relevant gap in research, as the choice of revegetation method is greatly based on economic aspects and the achievement of restoration goals goes beyond the establishment of plants. Finally, we identified a substantial volume of studies conducted in temperate regions and over short periods (0-5 y). This research cluster calls for a future in-depth synthesis, potentially through meta-analysis, to reveal the overall balance between seeding and planting and assess whether the response to this question is mediated by species traits, environmental characteristics, or technical aspects.

Drought stress (DS) is a formidable obstacle, disrupting normal plant functions through specific morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms. Understanding how plants navigate DS is paramount to mitigating its adverse effects. In response to DS, plants synthesize or accumulate various plant growth regulators (PGRs), including phytohormones, neurotransmitters, gasotransmitters, and polyamines, which present promising sustainable green chemical strategies to adapt or tolerate stress conditions. These PGRs orchestrate crucial plant structure and function adjustments, activating defense systems and modulating cellular-level responses, transcript levels, transcription factors, metabolic genes, and stress-responsive candidate proteins. However, the efficacy of these molecules in mitigating DS depends on the plant species, applied PGR dose, treatment type, duration of DS exposure, and growth stages. Thus, exploring the integrated impact of PGRs on enhancing plant fitness and DS tolerance is crucial for global food security and sustainable agriculture. This review investigates plant responses to DS, explains the potential of exogenously applied diverse PGRs, dissects the complex chemistry among PGRs, and sheds light on omics approaches for harnessing the molecular basis of DS tolerance.

Recent research has shown that the rhizosphere environment is far more dynamic than previously recognised, with evidence emerging for diurnal rhythmicity in rhizosphere chemistry and microbial community composition. This rhythmicity is in part linked to the host plant's circadian rhythm, although some heterotrophic rhizosphere bacteria and fungi may also possess intrinsic rhythmicity. We review the evidence for diurnal rhythmicity in rhizosphere microbial communities and its link to the plant circadian clock. Factors which may drive microbial rhythmicity are discussed, including diurnal change in root exudate flux and composition, rhizosphere physico-chemical properties and plant immunity. Microbial processes which could contribute to community rhythmicity are considered, including self-sustained microbial rhythms, bacterial movement into and out of the rhizosphere, and microbe-microbe interactions. We also consider evidence that changes in microbial composition mediated by the plant circadian clock may affect microbial function and its significance for plant health and broader soil biogeochemical cycling processes. We identify key knowledge gaps and approaches which could help to resolve the spatial and temporal variation and functional significance of rhizosphere microbial rhythmicity. This includes unravelling the factors which determine the oscillation of microbial activity, growth and death, and cross-talk with the host over diurnal time frames.

The application of safe and eco-friendly treatments is a very important strategy to overcome the adverse effects of drought and salinity on the growth characteristics and yield of plants. It is shown that treatments with plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can improve morphoanatomical characteristics under salinity and drought stress. It is also shown that yeast extract, mannitol, proline, melatonin, silicon, chitosan, α-Tocopherols (vitamin E), and biochar alleviate the negative effects of drought and salinity stresses through the ROS scavenging resulting in the improvement of plant attributes and yield of the stressed plants.

Following the stoppage of irrigation, and the post maintenance phase (2017-2021), modules initially planted with Sedum continued to sustain cover and biomass whereas planted forbs and grasses mostly disappeared, and these treatments were overtaken by Sedum.

Plant strategy theory is essential for understanding the assembly of plant communities, predicting plant responses to climate change, and enhancing the restoration of our degrading biosphere. However, models of plant strategies vary widely and have tended to emphasize either functional traits or life-history traits at the expense of integrating both into a general framework to improve our ecological and evolutionary understanding of plant form and function. Advancing our understanding of plant strategies will require investment in two complementary research agendas that together will unify functional ecology and population ecology. First, we must determine what is phenotypically possible by quantifying the dimensionality of plant traits. This step requires dense taxonomic sampling of traits on species representing the broad diversity of phylogenetic clades, environmental gradients, and geographical regions found across Earth. It is important that we continue to sample traits locally and share data globally to fill biased gaps in trait databases. Second, we must test the power of traits for explaining species distributions, demographic rates, and population growth rates across gradients of resource limitation, disturbance regimes, temperature, vegetation density, and frequencies of other strategies. This step requires thoughtful, theory-driven empiricism. Reciprocal transplant experiments beyond the native range and synthetic demographic modelling are the most powerful methods to determine how trait-by-environment interactions influence fitness. Moving beyond easy-to-measure traits and evaluating the traits that are under the strongest ecological selection within different environmental contexts will improve our understanding of plant adaptations. Plant strategy theory is poised to (i) unpack the multiple dimensions of productivity and disturbance gradients and differentiate adaptations to climate and resource limitation from adaptations to disturbance, (ii) distinguish between the fundamental and realized niches of phenotypes, and (iii) articulate the distinctions and relationships between functional traits and life-history traits.",,"Botany Department, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming, 82071, USA.",0

The user can rapidly move between scales that depict the entire genome, individual genes, and the sequence; Genome Explorer presents the most relevant detail and context for each scale. By downloading the data for the entire genome to the user's web browser and dynamically generating visualizations locally, we enable ﬁne control of zoom and pan functions and real-time redrawing of the visualization, resulting in smoother and more intuitive exploration of a genome than is possible with other browsers. Further, genome features are presented together, in-line, using familiar graphical depictions. In contrast, many other browsers depict genome features using data tracks, which have low information density and can visually obscure the relative positions of features. Genome Explorer diagrams have a high information density that provides larger amounts of genome context and sequence information to be presented in a given-sized monitor than for tracks-based browsers. Genome Explorer provides optional data tracks for the analysis of large-scale data sets and a unique comparative mode that aligns genomes at orthologous genes with synchronized zooming.

It represents a habitat where there is contact between seed-associated microbes and soil microbes, but it is studied less than other plant habitats. Previous studies on spermosphere microbiology were primarily culture based or did not sample the spermosphere soil as initially defined in space and time. Thus, the objectives of this study were to develop an efficient strategy to collect spermosphere soils around imbibing soybean and cotton in nonsterile soil and investigate changes in microbial communities. The method employed sufficiently collected spermosphere soil as initially defined in space by constraining the soil sampled with a cork borer and confining the soil to a 12-well microtiter plate. Spermosphere prokaryote composition changed over time and depended on the crop within 6 h after seeds were sown. By 12 to 18 h, crops had unique microbial communities in spermosphere soils. Prokaryote evenness dropped following seed imbibition, with the proliferation of copiotrophic soil bacteria. Due to their long history of plant growth promotion, prokaryote operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Burkholderia, Massilia, Azospirillum, and Pseudomonas were notable organisms enriched. Fungi and prokaryotes were hub taxa in cotton and soybean spermosphere networks. Additionally, the enriched taxa were not hubs in networks, suggesting that other taxa besides those enriched may be important for spermosphere communities. Overall, this study advances knowledge in the assembly of the plant microbiome early in a plant's life, which may have plant health implications in more mature plant growth stages. IMPORTANCE The central hypothesis of this research was that plant species and seed exudate release would alter the assembly of microbes in the spermosphere soil. Our research investigated the response of microbes to the initial burst of nutrients into the spermosphere soil, filling knowledge gaps from previous studies that pregerminated seeds under sterile conditions. We identified several copiotrophic bacterial lineages with a long history of plant growth promotion proliferating in response to the initial exudate release. With a comparative network approach, we show that these copiotrophic bacteria are not central to networks, demonstrating that other microbes (including fungi) may be important for community structure. This study improves knowledge on microbial dynamics in the understudied spermosphere and helps inform solutions for biologically or ecologically motivated solutions to spermosphere pathogens.",,"Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, USA.",0

Despite the high mortality associated with Chagas, relatively few parasite genomes have been assembled to date, with genome assemblies unavailable even for some commonly used laboratory strains. This is at least partially due to T. cruzi's highly complex and highly repetitive genome, which defies investigation using traditional short-read sequencing methods. In this study, we have generated a high-quality whole-genome assembly of the hybrid Tulahuen strain, a commercially available type VI strain, using long-read Nanopore sequencing without short-read scaffolding. The assembled genome contains 25% repeat regions, 17% variable multigene family members, and 27% transposable elements (TEs) and is of comparable quality with T. cruzi genome assemblies that utilized both long- and short-read data. Notably, we find that regions with TEs are significantly enriched for multicopy surface proteins, and that surface proteins are, on average, closer to TEs than to other coding regions. This finding suggests that mobile genetic elements such as transposons may drive recombination within surface protein gene families.

However, the complete genome sequence of genus Cysteiniphilum is lacking, and the genomic characteristics of genetic diversity, evolutionary dynamics, and pathogenicity have not been characterized. In this study, the complete genome of the first reported clinical isolate QT6929 of genus Cysteiniphilum was sequenced, and comparative genomics analyses to Francisella genus were conducted to unveil the genomic landscape and diversity of the genus Cysteiniphilum. Our results showed that the complete genome of QT6929 consists of one 2.61 Mb chromosome and a 76,819 bp plasmid. The calculated average nucleotide identity and DNA-DNA hybridization values revealed that two clinical isolates QT6929 and JM-1 should be reclassified as two novel species in genus Cysteiniphilum. Pan-genome analysis revealed genomic diversity within the genus Cysteiniphilum and an open pan-genome state. Genomic plasticity analysis exhibited abundant mobile genetic elements including genome islands, insertion sequences, prophages, and plasmids on Cysteiniphilum genomes, which facilitated the broad exchange of genetic material between Cysteiniphilum and other genera like Francisella and Legionella. Several potential virulence genes associated with lipopolysaccharide/lipooligosaccharide, capsule, and haem biosynthesis specific to clinical isolates were predicted and might contribute to their pathogenicity in humans.

While these species appear morphologically identical, differences exist in the genetic makeup, geographical range, and possibly the clinical presentation of infection. Here, we show genetic divergence between the cryptic species through both a Blastomyces species tree constructed from orthologous protein sequences and whole genome single-nucleotide variant phylogenomic analysis. Following linked-read sequencing and de novo genome assembly, we characterized and compared the genomes of 3 B. dermatitidis and 3 B. gilchristii isolates. The B. gilchristii genomes (73.25-75.4 Mb) were ∼8 Mb larger than the B. dermatitidis genomes (64.88-66.61 Mb). Average nucleotide identity was lower between genomes of different species than genomes of the same species, yet functional classification of genes suggested similar proteomes. The most striking difference involved long terminal repeat retrotransposons. Although the same retrotransposon elements were detected in the genomes, the quantity of elements differed between the 2 species. Gypsy retrotransposon content was significantly higher in B. gilchristii (38.04-39.26 Mb) than in B. dermatitidis (30.85-32.40 Mb), accounting for the majority of genome size difference between species. Age estimation and phylogenetic analysis of the reverse transcriptase domains suggested that these retrotransposons are relatively ancient, with genome insertion predating the speciation of B. dermatitidis and B. gilchristii.

Most tools are specialized for a single task, and additional eﬀorts are necessary to integrate and visualize the results. To ﬁll this gap, we developed zDB, an application integrating a Nextﬂow analysis pipeline and a Python visualization platform built on the Django framework. The application is available on GitHub (https://github.com/metagenlab/zDB) and from the bioconda channel. Starting from annotated Genbank ﬁles, zDB identiﬁes orthologs and infers a phylogeny for each orthogroup. A species phylogeny is also constructed from shared single-copy orthologs. The results can be enriched with Pfam protein domain prediction, Cluster of Orthologs Genes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotations, and Swissprot homologs. The web application allows searching for speciﬁc genes or annotations, running Blast queries, and comparing genomic regions and whole genomes. The metabolic capacities of organisms can be compared at either the module or pathway levels. Finally, users can run queries to examine the conservation of speciﬁc genes or annotations across a chosen subset of genomes and display the results as a list of genes, Venn diagram, or heatmaps. Those features make zDB useful for both bioinformaticians and researchers more accustomed to laboratory research.IMPORTANCEGenome comparison and analysis rely on many independent tools, leaving to scientists the burden to integrate and visualize their results for interpretation. To alleviate this burden, we have built zDB, a comparative genomics tool that includes both an analysis pipeline and a visualization platform.

Among other features, the interface allows users to visually compare whole genomes and targeted regions, assess the conservation of genes or metabolic pathways, perform Blast searches, or look for speciﬁc annotations.

We used chromosomal-level assemblies from eight Fusarium graminearum isolates to study structural variants and their role in fungal evolution. We generated the assemblies of four of these genomes after Oxford Nanopore sequencing. A total of 87 inversions, 159 translocations, 245 duplications, 58,489 insertions, and 34,102 deletions were detected. Regions of high recombination rate are associated with structural rearrangements, and a significant proportion of inversions, translocations, and duplications overlap with the repeat content of the genome, suggesting recombination and repeat elements are major factors in the origin of structural rearrangements in F. graminearum. Large insertions and deletions introduce presence-absence polymorphisms for many genes, including secondary metabolite biosynthesis cluster genes and predicted effectors genes. Translocation events were found to be shuffling predicted effector-rich regions of the genomes and are likely contributing to the gain and loss of effectors facilitated by recombination. Breakpoints of some structural rearrangements fall within coding sequences and are likely altering the protein products.

However, significant knowledge gaps exist in understanding the detailed mechanisms for this hardwood-pathogenic fungus. To address this issue, five monokaryotic P. fraxinea strains, SS1 to SS5, were isolated from the tree species Robinia pseudoacacia, and high polysaccharide-degrading activities and the fastest growth were found for P. fraxinea SS3 among the isolates. The whole genome of P. fraxinea SS3 was sequenced, and its unique CAZyme potential for tree pathogenicity was determined in comparison to the genomes of other nonpathogenic Polyporales. These CAZyme features are well conserved in a distantly related tree pathogen, Heterobasidion annosum. Furthermore, the carbon source-dependent CAZyme secretions of P. fraxinea SS3 and a nonpathogenic and strong white-rot Polyporales member, Phanerochaete chrysosporium RP78, were compared by activity measurements and proteomic analyses. As seen in the genome comparisons, P. fraxinea SS3 exhibited higher pectin-degrading activities and higher laccase activities than P. chrysosporium RP78, which were attributed to the secretion of abundant glycoside hydrolase family 28 (GH28) pectinases and auxiliary activity family 1_1 (AA1_1) laccases, respectively. These enzymes are possibly related to fungal invasion into the tree lumens and the detoxification of tree defense substances. Additionally, P. fraxinea SS3 showed secondary cell wall degradation capabilities at the same level as that of P. chrysosporium RP78. Overall, this study suggested mechanisms for how this fungus can attack the cell walls of living trees as a serious pathogen and differs from other nonpathogenic white-rot fungi. IMPORTANCE Many studies have been done to understand the mechanisms underlying the degradation of plant cell walls of dead trees by wood decay fungi. However, little is known about how some of these fungi weaken living trees as pathogens. P. fraxinea belongs to the Polyporales, a group of strong wood decayers, and is known to aggressively attack and fell standing hardwood trees all over the world. Here, we report CAZymes potentially related to plant cell wall degradation and pathogenesis factors in a newly isolated fungus, P. fraxinea SS3, by genome sequencing in conjunction with comparative genomic and secretomic analyses.
