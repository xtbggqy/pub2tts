Here we present data from the first phase of the Chinese Pangenome Consortium, including a collection of 116 high-quality and haplotype-phased de novo assemblies based on 58 core samples representing 36 minority Chinese ethnic groups. With an average 30.65× high-fidelity long-read sequence coverage, an average contiguity N50 of more than 35.63 megabases and an average total size of 3.01 gigabases, the CPC core assemblies add 189 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,367 protein-coding gene duplications to GRCh38. We identified 15.9 million small variants and 78,072 structural variants, of which 5.9 million small variants and 34,223 structural variants were not reported in a recently released pangenome reference1. The Chinese Pangenome Consortium data demonstrate a remarkable increase in the discovery of novel and missing sequences when individuals are included from underrepresented minority ethnic groups. The missing reference sequences were enriched with archaic-derived alleles and genes that confer essential functions related to keratinization, response to ultraviolet radiation, DNA repair, immunological responses and lifespan, implying great potential for shedding new light on human evolution and recovering missing heritability in complex disease mapping.",中国36个族群的泛基因组参考序列,民族；遗传变异；DNA序列分析；常染色质；DNA修复；少数群体；单倍型；人类基因组；东亚人群；参考标准；角蛋白；长寿；免疫；等位基因；种族与少数民族；人类遗传学；紫外线；人,"人类基因组学正经历从单一参考序列向泛基因组形式的范式转变，但亚洲血统人群在当前研究中代表性不足。本文报道了中国泛基因组联盟（Chinese Pangenome Consortium, CPC）第一阶段的研究成果，其中包括基于58个核心样本生成的116个高质量、单倍型分相的从头组装数据集，这些样本涵盖了36个中国少数民族群体。该数据集具有平均30.65倍高保真长读测序覆盖度，平均连续性N50超过35.63Mb，总基因组大小平均为3.01Gb。与GRCh38相比，CPC核心组装新增了1.89亿对常染色质多态性序列以及1,367个蛋白编码基因重复。我们鉴定出1,590万个小型变异和78,072个结构变异，其中590万个小型变异和34,223个结构变异未被最近发布的泛基因组参考数据所收录。CPC的数据表明，纳入代表性不足的少数民族个体能够显著提升新序列和缺失序列的发现效率。这些缺失的参考序列富集了源自远古的等位基因及基因，这些基因与角质化、紫外线响应、DNA修复、免疫反应及寿命调控等关键功能密切相关，暗示其在揭示人类进化机制和解析复杂疾病定位中缺失遗传力方面具有重要潜力。"

Poplars, among the world's most widely distributed and cultivated trees, exhibit extensive phenotypic diversity and environmental adaptability. In this study, we present a genus-level super-pangenome comprising 19 Populus genomes, revealing the likely pivotal role of private genes in facilitating local environmental and climate adaptation. Through the integration of pangenomes with transcriptomes, methylomes, and chromatin accessibility mapping, we unveil that the evolutionary trajectories of pangenes and duplicated genes are closely linked to local genomic landscapes of regulatory and epigenetic architectures, notably CG methylation in gene-body regions. Further comparative genomic analyses have enabled the identification of 142 202 structural variants across species that intersect with a significant number of genes and contribute substantially to both phenotypic and adaptive divergence. We have experimentally validated a ∼180-bp presence/absence variant affecting the expression of the CUC2 gene, crucial for leaf serration formation. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web-based tool encompassing the multi-omics resources associated with the Populus super-pangenome (http://www.populus-superpangenome.com).

By contrast, a pangenome incorporates multiple genomes to capture the entire set of nonredundant genes in a given species, along with its genome diversity. New sequencing technologies enable researchers to produce multiple high-quality genome sequences and catalog diverse genetic variations with better precision. Pangenomic studies have detected structural variants in plant genomes, dissected the genetic architecture of agronomic traits, and helped unravel molecular underpinnings and evolutionary origins of plant phenotypes. The pangenome concept has further evolved into a so-called superpangenome that includes wild relatives within a genus or clade and shifted to graph-based reference systems. Nevertheless, building pangenomes and representing complex structural variants remain challenging in many crops. Standardized computing pipelines and common data structures are needed to compare and interpret pangenomes. The growing body of plant pangenomics data requires new algorithms, huge data storage capacity, and training to help researchers and breeders take advantage of newly discovered genes and genetic variants.",,,

The term 'pangenome' is currently used to describe multiple different types of genomic information, and limited language is available to differentiate between them. This is frustrating for researchers working in the field and confusing for researchers new to the field.

Facilitated by advances in long-read DNA sequencing and genome assembly algorithms, complete human genome sequences resolve regions that have been historically difficult to sequence, including centromeres, telomeres, and segmental duplications. In parallel, pangenomes capture the extensive genetic diversity across populations worldwide.

One approach is to call and phase single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on a reference sequence. However, this approach becomes unstable on large segmental duplications (SDs) or structural variations (SVs) because the alignments of reads deriving from these regions tend to be unreliable. Another approach is to use highly accurate PacBio HiFi reads to output diploid assembly directly. Nonetheless, HiFi reads cannot phase homozygous regions longer than their length and require oxford nanopore technology (ONT) reads or Hi-C to produce a fully phased assembly. Is a single long-read sequencing technology sufficient to create an accurate diploid assembly? Here, we present JTK, a megabase-scale diploid genome assembler. It first randomly samples kilobase-scale sequences (called 'chunks') from the long reads, phases variants found on them, and produces two haplotypes. The novel idea of JTK is to utilize chunks to capture SNVs and SVs simultaneously. From 60-fold ONT reads on the HG002 and a Japanese sample, it fully assembled two haplotypes with approximately 99.9% accuracy on the histocompatibility complex (MHC) and the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) regions, which was impossible by the reference-based approach. In addition, in the LRC region on a Japanese sample, JTK output an assembly of better contiguity than those built from high-coverage HiFi+Hi-C. In the coming age of pan-genomics, JTK would complement the reference-based phasing method to assemble the difficult-to-assemble but medically important regions.

Reference-based approaches are thus blind to the dynamics of the accessory genome, as well as variation within gene order and copy number. With the widespread usage of long-read sequencing, the number of high-quality, complete genome assemblies has increased dramatically. In addition to pangenomic approaches that focus on the variation in the sets of genes present in different genomes, complete assemblies allow investigations of the evolution of genome structure and gene order. This latter problem, however, is computationally demanding with few tools available that shed light on these dynamics. Here, we present PanGraph, a Julia-based library and command line interface for aligning whole genomes into a graph.

How Viruses Shape Microbial Plankton Microdiversity.,Rodriguez-Valera Francisco; Bellas Christopher,Annual review of marine science,2024-11-25,未知,未知,未知,未知,未知,未知,未知,10.1146/annurev-marine-040623-090847,38950433,0,population genomics; Seawater; Plankton; Oceans and Seas; Biodiversity; phages; Viruses; constant-diversity equilibrium; kill-the-winner; pangenome; Virus Physiological Phenomena,"One major conundrum of modern microbiology is the large pangenome (gene pool) present in microbes, which is much larger than those found in complex organisms such as humans. Here, we argue that this diversity of gene pools carried by different strains is maintained largely due to the control exercised by viral predation. Viruses maintain a high strain diversity through time that we describe as constant-diversity equilibrium, preventing the hoarding of resources by specific clones. Thus, viruses facilitate the release and degradation of dissolved organic matter in the ocean, which may lead to better ecosystem functioning by linking top-down to bottom-up control. By maintaining this equilibrium, viruses act as a key element of the adaptation of marine microbes to their environment and likely behave as a single evolutionary unit.",,,

Sustainable wheat improvement requires the introduction of new genes and alleles in high-yielding wheat cultivars. Using new approaches, tools, and technologies to identify and introduce new genes in wheat cultivars is critical. High-quality genomes, transcriptomes, and pangenomes provide essential resources and tools to examine wheat closely to identify and manipulate new and targeted genes and alleles. Wheat genomics has improved excellently in the past 5 years, generating multiple genomes, pangenomes, and transcriptomes. Leveraging these resources allows us to accelerate our crop improvement pipelines. This review summarizes the progress made in wheat genomics and trait discovery in the past 5 years.",,,

This review discusses how recent breakthroughs in the genome assembly and analysis of wild grape species have led to discoveries on grape evolution, from wild species' adaptation to environmental stress to grape domestication. We detail how diploid chromosome-scale genomes from wild Vitis spp. have enabled the identification of candidate disease-resistance and flower sex determination genes and the creation of the first Vitis graph-based pangenome. Finally, we explore how wild grape genomics can impact grape research and viticulture, including aspects such as data sharing, the development of functional genomics tools, and the acceleration of genetic improvement.",,,
Mem-based pangenome indexing for k-mer queries.,Hwang Stephen; Brown Nathaniel K; Ahmed Omar Y; Jenike Katharine M; Kovaka Sam; Schatz Michael C; Langmead Ben,Algorithms for molecular biology : AMB,2025-03-01,未知,未知,未知,未知,未知,未知,未知,10.1186/s13015-025-00272-y,40025556,0,Comparative genomics; Pangenomics; Compressed indexing,"Pangenomes are growing in number and size, thanks to the prevalence of high-quality long-read assemblies. However, current methods for studying sequence composition and conservation within pangenomes have limitations. Methods based on graph pangenomes require a computationally expensive multiple-alignment step, which can leave out some variation. Indexes based on k-mers and de Bruijn graphs are limited to answering questions at a specific substring length k. We present Maximal Exact Match Ordered (MEMO), a pangenome indexing method based on maximal exact matches (MEMs) between sequences. A single MEMO index can handle arbitrary-length queries over pangenomic windows. MEMO enables both queries that test k-mer presence/absence (membership queries) and that count the number of genomes containing k-mers in a window (conservation queries). MEMO's index for a pangenome of 89 human autosomal haplotypes fits in 2.04 GB, 8.8 × smaller than a comparable KMC3 index and 11.4 × smaller than a PanKmer index. MEMO indexes can be made smaller by sacrificing some counting resolution, with our decile-resolution HPRC index reaching 0.67 GB. MEMO can conduct a conservation query for 31-mers over the human leukocyte antigen locus in 13.89 s, 2.5 × faster than other approaches. MEMO's small index size, lack of k-mer length dependence, and efficient queries make it a flexible tool for studying and visualizing substring conservation in pangenomes.",,,
Human Pangenomics: Promises and Challenges of a Distributed Genomic Reference.,Abondio Paolo; Cilli Elisabetta; Luiselli Donata,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2023-06-09,未知,未知,未知,未知,未知,未知,未知,10.3390/life13061360,37374141,0,evolution; selection; human genomics; structural variation; pangenomics; phylogenetics; bioinformatics; pangenome; public health; personalized medicine,"A pangenome is a collection of the common and unique genomes that are present in a given species. It combines the genetic information of all the genomes sampled, resulting in a large and diverse range of genetic material. Pangenomic analysis offers several advantages compared to traditional genomic research. For example, a pangenome is not bound by the physical constraints of a single genome, so it can capture more genetic variability. Thanks to the introduction of the concept of pangenome, it is possible to use exceedingly detailed sequence data to study the evolutionary history of two different species, or how populations within a species differ genetically. In the wake of the Human Pangenome Project, this review aims at discussing the advantages of the pangenome around human genetic variation, which are then framed around how pangenomic data can inform population genetics, phylogenetics, and public health policy by providing insights into the genetic basis of diseases or determining personalized treatments, targeting the specific genetic profile of an individual. Moreover, technical limitations, ethical concerns, and legal considerations are discussed.",,,
Frontiers of soybean pan-genome studies.,Liu Yu-Cheng; Shen Yan-Ting; Tian Zhi-Xi,Yi chuan = Hereditas,2024-03-20,未知,未知,未知,未知,未知,未知,未知,10.16288/j.yczz.23-321,38632097,0,"Genomics; evolution; Sequence Analysis, DNA; soybean; Genome, Plant; Glycine max; domestication; structural variation; Plant Breeding; pan-genome","Artificial domestication provided the original motivation to the blooming of agriculture, following with the dramatic change of the genetic background of crops and livestock. According to theory and technology upgradation that contributing to the omics, we appreciate using the pan-genome instead of single reference genome for crop study. By comparison and integration of multiple genomes under the guidance of pan-genome theory, we can estimate the genomic information range of a species, leading to a global understanding of its genetic diversity. Combining pan-genome with large size chromosomal structural variations, high throughput population resequencing, and multi-omics data, we can profoundly study the genetic basis behind species traits we focus on. Soybean is one of the most important commercial crops over the world. It is also essential to our food security. Dissecting the formation of genetic diversity and the causal loci of key agricultural traits of soybean will make the modern soybean breeding more efficiently. In this review, we summarize the core idea of pan-genome and clarified the characteristics of construction strategies of pan-genome such as de novo/mapping assembly, iterative assembly and graph-based genome. Then we used the soybean pan-genome work as a case study to introduce the general way to study pan-genome. We highlighted the contribution of structural variation (SV) to the evolution/domestication of soybean and its value in understanding the genetic bases of agronomy traits. By those, we approved the value of graph-based pan-genome for data integration and SV calculation. Future research directions are also discussed for crop genomics and data science.",,,
