Poplars, among the world's most widely distributed and cultivated trees, exhibit extensive phenotypic diversity and environmental adaptability. In this study, we present a genus-level super-pangenome comprising 19 Populus genomes, revealing the likely pivotal role of private genes in facilitating local environmental and climate adaptation. Through the integration of pangenomes with transcriptomes, methylomes, and chromatin accessibility mapping, we unveil that the evolutionary trajectories of pangenes and duplicated genes are closely linked to local genomic landscapes of regulatory and epigenetic architectures, notably CG methylation in gene-body regions. Further comparative genomic analyses have enabled the identification of 142 202 structural variants across species that intersect with a significant number of genes and contribute substantially to both phenotypic and adaptive divergence. We have experimentally validated a ∼180-bp presence/absence variant affecting the expression of the CUC2 gene, crucial for leaf serration formation. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web-based tool encompassing the multi-omics resources associated with the Populus super-pangenome (http://www.populus-superpangenome.com).

Here, we argue that this diversity of gene pools carried by different strains is maintained largely due to the control exercised by viral predation. Viruses maintain a high strain diversity through time that we describe as constant-diversity equilibrium, preventing the hoarding of resources by specific clones. Thus, viruses facilitate the release and degradation of dissolved organic matter in the ocean, which may lead to better ecosystem functioning by linking top-down to bottom-up control. By maintaining this equilibrium, viruses act as a key element of the adaptation of marine microbes to their environment and likely behave as a single evolutionary unit.",10.1146/annurev-marine-040623-090847,Q1

Some species have fluid pangenomes, with a high proportion of genes varying between individual genomes. Other species have less fluid pangenomes, with different genomes tending to contain the same genes. Two main hypotheses have been suggested to explain this variation: differences in species' bacterial lifestyle and effective population size. However, previous studies have not been able to test between these hypotheses because the different features of lifestyle and effective population size are highly correlated with each other, and phylogenetically conserved, making it hard to disentangle their relative importance. We used phylogeny-based analyses, across 126 bacterial species, to tease apart the causal role of different factors. We found that pangenome fluidity was lower in i) host-associated compared with free-living species and ii) host-associated species that are obligately dependent on a host, live inside cells, and are more pathogenic and less motile. In contrast, we found no support for the competing hypothesis that larger effective population sizes lead to more fluid pangenomes. Effective population size appears to correlate with pangenome variation because it is also driven by bacterial lifestyle, rather than because of a causal relationship.",10.1073/pnas.2320170121,Q1

Yet when comparing a sample to a pangenome, variants in the pangenome that are not part of the sample can be misleading, for example, causing false read mappings. These irrelevant variants are generally rarer in terms of allele frequency, and have previously been dealt with by filtering rare variants. However, this blunt heuristic both fails to remove some irrelevant variants and removes many relevant variants. We propose a new approach that imputes a personalized pangenome subgraph by sampling local haplotypes according to k-mer counts in the reads. We implement the approach in the vg toolkit ( https://github.com/vgteam/vg ) for the Giraffe short-read aligner and compare its accuracy to state-of-the-art methods using human pangenome graphs from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium.

While domestic animals tend to have complex routes of origin and migration, suggesting a possible omission of some population-specific sequences in the current reference genome. Conversely, the pangenome is a collection of all DNA sequences of a species that contains sequences shared by all individuals (core genome) and is also able to display sequence information unique to each individual (variable genome). The progress of pangenome research in humans, plants and domestic animals has proved that the missing genetic components and the identification of large structural variants (SVs) can be explored through pangenomic studies. Many individual specific sequences have been shown to be related to biological adaptability, phenotype and important economic traits. The maturity of technologies and methods such as third-generation sequencing, Telomere-to-telomere genomes, graphic genomes, and reference-free assembly will further promote the development of pangenome. In the future, pangenome combined with long-read data and multi-omics will help to resolve large SVs and their relationship with the main economic traits of interest in domesticated animals, providing better insights into animal domestication, evolution and breeding. In this review, we mainly discuss how pangenome analysis reveals genetic variations in domestic animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, chickens) and their impacts on phenotypes and how this can contribute to the understanding of species diversity.

Pangenome analysis predominantly leverages graph-based methods that require computationally intensive multiple genome alignments, do not scale to highly complex eukaryotic genomes, limit their scope to identifying structural variants (SVs), or incur bias by relying on a reference genome. Here, we present PanKmer, a toolkit designed for reference-free analysis of pangenome datasets consisting of dozens to thousands of individual genomes. PanKmer decomposes a set of input genomes into a table of observed k-mers and their presence-absence values in each genome. These are stored in an efficient k-mer index data format that encodes SNPs, INDELs, and SVs. It also includes functions for downstream analysis of the k-mer index, such as calculating sequence similarity statistics between individuals at whole-genome or local scales. For example, k-mers can be ""anchored"" in any individual genome to quantify sequence variability or conservation at a specific locus. This facilitates workflows with various biological applications, e.g. identifying cases of hybridization between plant species. PanKmer provides researchers with a valuable and convenient means to explore the full scope of genetic variation in a population, without reference bias.

Bacteroides fragilis is a Gram-negative anaerobe that is a member of the human gastrointestinal microbiota and is frequently found as an extra-intestinal opportunistic pathogen. B. fragilis comprises two distinct groups - divisions I and II - characterized by the presence/absence of genes [cepA and ccrA (cfiA), respectively] that confer resistance to β-lactam antibiotics by either serine or metallo-β-lactamase production. No large-scale analyses of publicly available B. fragilis sequence data have been undertaken, and the resistome of the species remains poorly defined.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Reclassification of divisions I and II B. fragilis as two distinct species has been proposed but additional evidence is required.Aims. To investigate the genomic diversity of GenBank B. fragilis genomes and establish the prevalence of division I and II strains among publicly available B. fragilis genomes, and to generate further evidence to demonstrate that B. fragilis division I and II strains represent distinct genomospecies.Methodology. High-quality (n=377) genomes listed as B. fragilis in GenBank were included in pangenome and functional analyses. Genome data were also subject to resistome profiling using The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database.Results. Average nucleotide identity and phylogenetic analyses showed B. fragilis divisions I and II represent distinct species: B. fragilis sensu stricto (n=275 genomes) and B. fragilis A (n=102 genomes; Genome Taxonomy Database designation), respectively. Exploration of the pangenome of B. fragilis sensu stricto and B. fragilis A revealed separation of the two species at the core and accessory gene levels.Conclusion. The findings indicate that B. fragilis A, previously referred to as division II B. fragilis, is an individual species and distinct from B. fragilis sensu stricto. The B. fragilis pangenome analysis supported previous genomic, phylogenetic and resistome screening analyses collectively reinforcing that divisions I and II are two separate species. In addition, it was confirmed that differences in the accessory genes of B. fragilis divisions I and II are primarily associated with carbohydrate metabolism and suggest that differences other than antimicrobial resistance could also be used to distinguish between these two species.",10.1099/jmm.0.001768,Q3

However, the genomic interpretation of these viruses is hampered by a lack of functional information, stemming from the surprising number of hypothetical genes of unknown function. It is also unclear how many of these genes are widely shared within the clade. Using one of the most extensively characterized genera, Coccolithovirus, as a case study, we combined pangenome analysis, multiple functional annotation tools, AlphaFold structural modeling, and literature analysis to compare the core and accessory pangenome and assess support for novel functional predictions. We determined that the Coccolithovirus pangenome shares 30% of its genes with all 14 strains, making up the core. Notably, 34% of its genes were found in at most three strains. Core genes were enriched in early expression based on a transcriptomic dataset of Coccolithovirus EhV-201 algal infection, were more likely to be similar to host proteins than the non-core set, and were more likely to be involved in vital functions such as replication, recombination, and repair. In addition, we generated and collated annotations for the EhV representative EhV-86 from 12 different annotation sources, building up information for 142 previously hypothetical and putative membrane proteins.

Fifty-one unique C. ureolyticus isolates were identified between January 2010 and August 2022, mostly originating from abscesses and blood cultures. To clarify the taxonomic relationships between isolates and to attribute specific genes with different clinical manifestations, we sequenced 19 available isolates from a variety of clinical specimen types and conducted a pangenomic analysis with publicly available C. ureolyticus genomes. Digital DNA:DNA hybridization suggested that these C. ureolyticus comprised a species complex of 10 species clusters (SCs) and several subspecies clusters. Although some orthologous genes or gene functions were enriched in isolates found in different SCs and clinical specimens, no association was significant. Nearly a third of the isolates possessed antimicrobial resistance genes, including the ermA resistance gene, potentially conferring resistance to macrolides, the treatment of choice for severe human campylobacteriosis.

Our pangenome-wide presence and absence variation (PAV) analysis revealed 5,120 PAV-related genes, highlighting a wide range of variety-specific genes and genes with varying frequencies across yak populations. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on binary gene PAV data classified yaks into three new groups: wild, domestic, and Jinchuan. Moreover, we proposed a 'two-haplotype genomic hybridization model' for understanding the hybridization patterns among breeds by integrating gene frequency, heterozygosity, and gene PAV data. A gene PAV-GWAS identified a novel gene (BosGru3G009179) that may be associated with the multirib trait in Jinchuan yaks. Furthermore, an integrated transcriptome and pangenome analysis highlighted the significant differences in the expression of core genes and the mutational burden of differentially expressed genes between yaks from high and low altitudes. Transcriptome analysis across multiple species revealed that yaks have the most unique differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs (between high- and low-altitude regions), especially in the heart and lungs, when comparing high- and low-altitude adaptations.

Ferragina and Fischer [1] observed in 2007 that word-based indexes often use fewer random accesses than character-based indexes, and thus support faster searches. Since DNA lacks natural word-boundaries, however, it is necessary to parse it somehow before applying word-based FM-indexing. In 2022, Deng et al. [2] proposed parsing genomic data by induced suffix sorting, and showed that the resulting word-based FM-indexes support faster counting queries than standard FM-indexes when patterns are a few thousand characters or longer. In this paper we show that using prefix-free parsing-which takes parameters that let us tune the average length of the phrases-instead of induced suffix sorting, gives a significant speedup for patterns of only a few hundred characters. We implement our method and demonstrate it is between 3 and 18 times faster than competing methods on queries to GRCh38, and is consistently faster on queries made to 25,000, 50,000 and 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

We developed pangene, a computational tool to identify gene orientation, gene order and gene copy-number changes in a collection of genomes. Pangene aligns a set of input protein sequences to the genomes, resolves redundancies between protein sequences and constructs a gene graph with each genome represented as a walk in the graph. It additionally finds subgraphs, which we call bibubbles, that capture gene content changes. Applied to the human pangenome, pangene identifies known gene-level variations and reveals complex haplotypes that are not well studied before.

Fortunately, many valuable genes and alleles associated with desirable traits like disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, plant architecture, and nutrition qualities exist in landraces, ancestral species, and crop wild relatives. The novel genes from the wild ancestors and landraces can be introduced back to high-yielding varieties of modern crops by implementing classical plant breeding, genomic selection, and transgenic/gene editing approaches.

We comprehensively discuss the advancements in pangenome-based genomic integrative genomic discoveries across forensic-related species (humans, animals, and plants) and summarize their applications in variant identification and forensic genomics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, and microbiome research. Recent developments in multiplexed array sequencing have introduced a highly efficient and programmable technique to overcome the limitations of short forensic marker lengths in LRS platforms. This technique enables the concatenation of short RNA transcripts and DNA fragments into LRS-optimal molecules for sequencing, assembly, and genotyping. The integration of new pangenome reference coordinates and corresponding computational algorithms will benefit forensic integrative genomics by facilitating new marker identification, accurate genotyping, high-resolution panel development, and the updating of statistical algorithms.
