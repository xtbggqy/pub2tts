To understand the pattern of sugar accumulation during chestnut nut development, the related enzyme gene regulatory pathways, and the molecular regulatory mechanisms of chestnut sugar biosynthesis metabolism, two chestnut varieties with different sugar content, namely Chengbu Youzhu (hereinafter referred to as CBYZ) and AnYou No. 1 (hereinafter referred to as AY01), were selected for investigation. Total sugar and starch content, and the activity of enzymes related to sugar accumulation, were measured in the nuts of the two chestnut varieties 10 days after flowering (DAF), 20 DAF, 30 DAF, 40 DAF, 50 DAF, 60 DAF, 70 DAF, 80 DAF, and 90 DAF. Changes in starch, straight-chain starch, and branched-chain starch content, and sucrose-phosphate synthase, soluble starch synthase, and granule-bound starch synthase enzyme activities were consistent with one-another. A total of 24 differentially expressed genes between the two varieties were associated with sugar biosynthesis and metabolism at three key stages (30, 60, and 90 DAF) of sugar accumulation. Further analysis showing upregulation of the expression of starch-related genes, such as β-amylase, GYS, and INV indicated that these genes were not actively expressed in AY01, resulting in slow accumulation of starch and reduced sugar content. By contrast, the downregulation of the expression of genes, such as PGK and MDH1, indicated that these genes were actively expressed in low-sugar chestnuts, resulting in the rapid fermentation of sugars. A link between gene up- or down-regulation during different developmental stages of chestnut and the effect of their expression on sugar content were established by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. These findings provide further insights into the mechanism of sugar biosynthesis in chestnuts.", "abstract_zh": "毛栗（*Castanea mollissima* Bl.）是中国重要的粮食作物，富含营养成分。为探究毛栗果实发育过程中糖分积累的规律、与糖分积累相关的酶基因调控途径及毛栗糖分生物合成代谢的分子调控机制，本研究选取了糖分含量存在显著差异的两个毛栗品种——城步油柱（简称CBYZ）和安义1号（简称AY01），于开花后10天（DAF）、20 DAF、30 DAF、40 DAF、50 DAF、60 DAF、70 DAF、80 DAF和90 DAF时，分别检测两种毛栗坚果中的总糖和淀粉含量以及与糖分积累相关的酶活性。结果表明，淀粉、直链淀粉和支链淀粉含量的变化趋势与蔗糖磷酸合成酶、可溶性淀粉合成酶及颗粒结合型淀粉合成酶活性的变化相一致。在糖分积累的三个关键时期（30、60和90 DAF），共鉴定出24个与糖分生物合成和代谢相关的差异表达基因。进一步分析显示，与淀粉代谢相关基因如β-淀粉酶、GYS和INV的上调表达表明这些基因在AY01品种中表达水平较低，导致淀粉积累缓慢且糖分含量偏低；而PGK和MDH1等基因的下调表达则提示其在低糖品种中高表达，促进了糖分的快速分解利用。通过KEGG通路富集分析，阐明了毛栗不同发育阶段基因表达的上调或下调与其糖分含量变化之间的关联。上述研究结果为深入解析毛栗糖分生物合成机制提供了重要线索。", "authors": "Zhang Chenbo; Chen Xiaonuan; Liu Wang; Ji Yuena; Yang Yan; Chen Jingzhen; Li Peiwang; Li Dangxun", "journal": "Journal of plant physiology", "impact_factor": "11.4", "quartile": "Q1"}

Dicer recognizes and cleaves virus-derived double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and/or structured single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) into small-interfering RNAs, which guide effector Argonaute to homologous viral RNAs for digestion and inhibit virus replication. Thus, Argonaute is believed to be essential for antiviral RNAi. Here, we show Argonaute-independent, Dicer-dependent antiviral defense against dsRNA viruses using Cryphonectria parasitica (chestnut blight fungus), which is a model filamentous ascomycetous fungus and hosts a variety of viruses. The fungus has two dicer-like genes (dcl1 and dcl2) and four argonaute-like genes (agl1 to agl4). We prepared a suite of single to quadruple agl knockout mutants with or without dcl disruption. We tested these mutants for antiviral activities against diverse dsRNA viruses and ssRNA viruses. Although both DCL2 and AGL2 worked as antiviral players against some RNA viruses, DCL2 without argonaute was sufficient to block the replication of other RNA viruses. Overall, these results indicate the existence of a Dicer-alone defense and different degrees of susceptibility to it among RNA viruses. We discuss what determines the great difference in susceptibility to the Dicer-only defense.", "abstract_zh": "病毒RNA干扰（RNAi）在酵母到哺乳动物中均高度保守。Dicer能够识别并切割由病毒来源的双链RNA（dsRNA）和/或结构化的单链RNA（ssRNA），生成小干扰RNA（siRNA），引导效应蛋白Argonaute靶向同源病毒RNA进行降解，从而抑制病毒复制。因此，Argonaute被认为是抗病毒RNAi的核心组成部分。然而，本研究通过以栗疫菌（Cryphonectria parasitica）为模式丝状子囊菌的实验发现，该生物体内存在一种独立于Argonaute但依赖于Dicer的抗病毒防御机制。栗疫菌含有两个Dicer样基因（dcl1和dcl2）以及四个Argonaute样基因（agl1至agl4）。我们构建了一系列单至四重agl敲除突变体，并结合dcl基因的破坏，系统评估了这些突变体对多种dsRNA病毒和ssRNA病毒的抗病毒活性。结果显示，尽管DCL2与AGL2在部分RNA病毒的抗病毒过程中发挥作用，但在缺乏Argonaute的情况下，DCL2仍可单独有效抑制其他RNA病毒的复制。总体而言，这些结果表明，存在一种仅依赖Dicer的抗病毒防御机制，且RNA病毒对该机制的敏感性存在显著差异。我们进一步探讨了决定RNA病毒对Dicer-only防御机制敏感性差异的关键因素。", "authors": "Sato Yukiyo; Kondo Hideki; Suzuki Nobuhiro", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "impact_factor": "11.1", "quartile": "Q1"}
